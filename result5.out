A: It's got a big yard.
B: The kids love the house, too.

B: So do I.
A: How much is it?
B: I don't know. The tag is missing.
A: Ask the clerk.
B: I will.
A: Oh, look. Here's another shirt just like it.
B: Does it have a price tag?
A: Yes, it does. It's only $20.
B: That's a great price.
A: I think I'll buy both of them.
B: You'd better try them on first.



A: Why is there so much crime?
B: Because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.
A: Is that it?
B: Also, there aren't enough police.
A: But there are a lot of police.
B: There's only one police officer per 100 criminals.
A: Can't we hire more police?

B: I think everyone will.



A: My back is killing me.
B: What did you do?
A: I got out of my car.
B: That's it?
A: I injured my back one time just by sneezing.
B: You should see a doctor.
A: My doctor said I need surgery.
B: So?
A: So, forget it.
B: You don't have the money?
A: I have no insurance.
B: Maybe a back rub would help.



A: I think I have the worst boss in the world.
B: What makes him so bad?
A: He's rude and he yells a lot.
B: That's hard to take.
A: I've never heard him say please or thank you.
B: He sounds like a real jerk.
A: No one at work likes him.
B: Can't you report him to his supervisor?
A: Of course not. If I do that, I'll lose my job.
B: Yes, they don't like troublemakers or complainers.
A: I can't quit, because I'm making a good salary.
B: You shouldn't choose money over happiness.

A: They're behind the outfield.
B: Maybe we can catch a home run ball.



A: I don't believe the art world.
B: What is it this time?
A: An Andy Warhol drawing.
B: He's a famous artist.
A: He drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.
B: Did he sign it?
A: Yes.
B: Is it beautiful?
A: It's just black ink on a white napkin. And the napkin has food stains!
B: So it's not worth much?
A: Only about $30,000.
B: Without the food stains, it would probably be worth more.



A: I see that former President Bush is at a conference.
B: Yes. He's telling jokes about his eight years as president.
A: Yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.
B: Only 4,000 American soldiers were killed overseas.
A: Not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.
B: But Bush visited some of them in the hospital once.
A: That's nice that he found the time to make a visit.
B: He spoke to them and made them feel better.
A: Did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?
B: No, he didn't have time to do that.
A: Well, he's got plenty of time now!

A: The city is buying guns.
B: What are they paying?
A: Up to $200 for each gun, no questions asked.

B: A good gun costs $400 or more.
A: Well, if you bring your receipt, maybe they'll give you $400.
B: I'll keep my receipt and my gun.
A: I didn't know you had a gun.
B: Everyone in America should have a gun.



A: Bears are invading our neighborhoods.
B: Of course they are. They're starving to death.
A: They should stay in the woods where they belong.
B: There's no food in the woods.
A: Can't they eat grass?
B: Do you think a bear is a cow?
A: Well, I've seen them eating berries.
B: Berries aren't in season all year round.
A: It's too dangerous for kids and pets.
B: People need to cover their trash cans.
A: The police need to shoot all the bears.
B: You don't solve a problem by shooting it.



A: I'm stuffed.
B: Of course you are. You ate everything on the table.
A: I don't like to eat leftovers.
B: I'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.
A: I like my food hot and fresh.
B: You like to see it disappear.
A: I don't like it reheated.
B: Well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night.
A: I'm so full I'm going to burst.

B: I was there when I was a kid.
A: How did you like it?
B: I loved it. I still remember how amazing it was.
A: I'm sure I'll like it, too.
B: You should try riding a mule on a trail to the bottom.
A: No way! I don't want to fall to my death.
B: Don't worry. Only one person has ever fallen off a mule.



A: I'm trying to stretch my dollars.
B: How are you doing that?
A: I started shopping at the dollar store.
B: That saves a lot of money.
A: I bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.
B: That's a good deal.
A: Yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.
B: Just put them in the fridge.
A: Also, I bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.
B: Why did you do that?
A: I mixed them together.
B: If the coffee still tastes okay, that's a good idea.



A: You're yawning.
B: I sure am.
A: You should go to bed.
B: I will as soon as I finish this article.
A: What are you reading?
B: It's about crime in Los Angeles.
A: What does it say?
B: The mayor says the crime rate is going down.
A: Then why does everyone lock their doors?
B: I guess they haven't read this article.
A: No one believes that the crime rate is going down.
B: Maybe the mayor is just talking about his own neighborhood.



A: I saw what you did.
B: I didn't do anything.
A: Oh yes, you did.
B: What are you talking about?
A: You know what I'm talking about.
B: I don't have any idea.
A: You know what you did.
B: Maybe I know, but how could you know?
A: Because I was watching you.
B: Okay, I'm sorry I did it.
A: Don't drink milk out of the carton. Use a glass!
B: I promise I'll never drink out of the carton again.



A: Did you get your Official Sample Ballot?
B: Yes, with the Voter Instructions.
A: How are you going to vote?
B: Same as ever, by mail. All it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.
A: I meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?
B: Against all of them, of course.
A: But we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons.
B: We've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!
A: That's true. Where did that money go?
B: Our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.
A: They are having a good time with our money.
B: So when are we going to stop giving them more?



A: Golf is so hard.
B: What's so hard about hitting a little white ball?
A: It's hard if you want to do it right.
B: You mean like Tiger?
A: No, like a good amateur golfer.
B: What's so hard about golf?
A: There are so many things you have to do right.
B: Like what?
A: Like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through.
B: Yikes! Who can remember all that?
A: You need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.
B: Forget it. Golf sounds more like work than fun.



A: That hotel was terrible.
B: The worst in the whole world.
A: The walls were so thin.
B: All day long we heard TVs or telephones.
A: All night long we heard people snoring.
B: Housekeeping didn't give us fresh towels.
A: Room service brought us a cold dinner.
B: Our nonsmoking room stunk of cigarette smoke.
A: Our room was right next to the elevator and the ice machine.
B: They added phony charges to our bill.
A: How did we end up in that terrible hotel?
B: The travel agent gave us a 50-percent discount!



A: What are we going to do?
B: About what?
A: About finding a job for me.
B: You don't need a job. I make enough money for both of us.
A: That doesn't matter. I don't want to sit around.
B: Okay, what kind of job do you want?
A: I'm not sure.
B: Well, you should do something that you enjoy.
A: I enjoy selling. I was born to sell.
B: Okay, what do you want to sell?
A: Cigarette lighters. I'll make a fortune.
B: But you hate cigarettes and you hate smoking!



A: My brother smokes three packs a day.
B: Three packs of what?
A: Cigarettes, of course.
B: How can he do that?
A: When he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another.
B: He's a chain smoker.
A: He's been a chain smoker for 30 years.
B: That's unbelievable. Can he still breathe?
A: He can, but the people around him can't.
B: How can he still be alive?
A: His doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.
B: Maybe I should start smoking.



A: I have to hang up. I'm so sleepy.
B: It's not even 10 o'clock.
A: I'm falling asleep on the phone.
B: You got up real early.
A: I had to take my friend to the airport.
B: Why didn't you take a nap when you got home?
A: I didn't get home until 30 minutes ago.
B: Why is that?
A: There was a bomb threat at the airport.
B: Only a threat?
A: Yes, but I was stuck there all day while they looked for the bomb.
B: Someday the bomb is going to be for real.



A: Did you hear about the ball player?
B: The home run hitter on drugs?
A: He said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.
B: He said he wasn't using drugs.
A: He apologized to the fans.
B: The league suspended him for 50 games.
A: That will cost him some money.
B: Yes, about $7 million.
A: That will teach him a good lesson.
B: He probably won't use drugs anymore.
A: But it won't stop other players from using drugs.
B: No. Everyone always figures that they won't get caught.



A: I hate brushing my teeth.
B: It's such a chore.
A: Brush, brush. Spit, spit.
B: What did they do in the old days?
A: They brushed with their fingers.
B: They also ate with their fingers!
A: Why do they call it the good old days?
B: Maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss.
A: Who invented flossing?
B: A dentist, I'm sure.
A: I hate flossing more than brushing!
B: I can't wait till all my teeth fall out.



A: A new hotel is looking for workers.
B: Yes, I saw it on the TV news.
A: They need 300 new workers.
B: And 4,000 people showed up.
A: So many people are out of work.
B: I still have my job, thank goodness.
A: So do I, but I'm worried.
B: Me too. There are no guarantees.
A: If you lose your job, you can move in with me.
B: Oh, thank you. That's very nice of you.
A: You would do the same for me.
B: Of course. What are friends for?



A: Have you decided how you are going to vote?
B: Do you mean on Measures 1, 2, and 3?
A: Yes. The ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.
B: You mean the measures that will raise our taxes.
A: But the TV ads say that our taxes will not increase.
B: Do you believe the TV ads?
A: I like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote Yes.
B: Don't believe him! Whatever the TV ads tell you, the opposite is true.
A: But the title of Measure 1 is "Better Schools at No Cost."
B: The title should be "Better Schools at Huge Cost."
A: I can't believe that they would lie to us.
B: Of course they lie that's what politicians do!



A: People who live in California are crazy.
B: Why is that?
A: Because of all the earthquakes and fires.
B: But big earthquakes happen only once in a while.
A: Once in a while is once too many.
B: But you're right. There are a lot of fires.
A: A recent fire destroyed 85 homes.
B: Still, it's safer than Florida.
A: Florida doesn't have earthquakes or fires.
B: No, Florida just has hurricanes every year from June to October.
A: But most of those hurricanes are harmless.
B: Excuse me. Hurricane Andrew destroyed 30,000 homes!

B: Why did he do that?
A: He was invited, along with about 90 other veterans.
B: Who invited them?
A: Some private organization.
B: Why did they invite him?
A: To thank him and all the other soldiers who served in World War II.
B: That's very nice.
A: My dad got to see the beautiful new World War II Monument.
B: That trip must have cost a lot of money. 
A: He said all the money came from private donations.



A: Let's stop for a while. I need a break and some water.
B: This trail is hard to climb.
A: Especially on a hot day like this.
B: I can't believe we haven't seen any animals.
A: Thank goodness! I don't want to see any wild animals.
B: All we've seen so far is a couple of lizards.
A: We're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears.
B: I bet I've lost a couple of pounds already.
A: All you've lost is some sweat.
B: I haven't even lost one pound of fat?
A: If you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day.
B: Okay, but let's hike in town. At least there are cats and dogs to see.



A: I think I did something real stupid.
B: What did you do?
A: I bought some stock.
B: Everybody buys stock.
A: I bought it on a hunch.
B: You didn't read about the company first?
A: I didn't have to. It's been in business for 60 years.
B: So what's the problem?
A: I used all my savings on this one company.
B: You put all your eggs into one basket.
A: If the company goes out of business, I'll have nothing.
B: Oh, you'll have something you'll have a lesson you'll never forget!



A: Oh no, another pimple on my face.
B: Pimples suck.
A: It seems like I get a new pimple almost every day.
B: Maybe it's something in your diet.
A: No, I eat the same things day after day.
B: Then maybe it's in your genes.
A: You might be right.
B: Do pimples run in your family?
A: Not that I've noticed.
B: Well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air.
A: Whatever the cause, I hate seeing them on my face.
B: Well, on the bright side, they're fun to pop.



A: I was going to be a doctor.
B: What happened to your plans?
A: I got a D in college chemistry.
B: Well, a D is better than an F.
A: A tutor helped me get the D!
B: So, you didn't become a doctor.
A: And now I'm glad that I didn't.
B: Why's that?
A: A hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.
B: Oh, yes, because of all the killer germs.
A: If you're a smart doctor, you stay away from hospitals.
B: Yes, the smart doctors are those TV news doctors no hospitals, no patients.



A: I want to be a mail carrier when I grow up.
B: Why?
A: Because you get to meet a lot of people.
B: You sure do.
A: And you get a lot of exercise every day.
B: That's the truth.
A: And you get to play with a lot of dogs.
B: Well, you're supposed to be working.
A: Yes, but I will always pet the friendly dogs.
B: What about the unfriendly dogs?
A: I think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you.
B: Dogs are like people not all of them are friendly.



A: Do you believe everything you hear?
B: I don't believe anything I don't see with my own eyes.
A: You can't believe what you hear on TV or radio.
B: You can't believe what you read in the newspapers.
A: Everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.
B: Three different people will give you three different stories.
A: And the government will give you a fourth story.
B: Yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu.
A: But the swine flu just killed 20 people in Mexico.
B: The government says we have nothing to worry about.
A: Then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home?
B: The government says to wash our hands frequently, and we'll all be okay.



A: I want to move to New York.
B: To the state or the city?
A: To the city, of course.
B: Why do you want to move there?
A: Because I want to make a lot of money.
B: There are a lot of poor people in New York.
A: There sure are at least a million.
B: So how do you plan to become rich?
A: I will knock on the doors of all the corporations.
B: That won't make you rich. Nobody will talk to you.
A: I will keep knocking on doors.
B: All you will get is sore knuckles.



A: Don't pick your nose.
B: I wasn't picking my nose.
A: What were you doing?
B: I was scratching my nose.
A: I think I know the difference between picking and scratching.
B: Okay, mom, maybe I was picking it a little bit.
A: Use a tissue next time.
B: I didn't have a tissue.
A: Then wait till you find a tissue.
B: I couldn't wait. It was an emergency.
A: Oh, really? Maybe you should have called 911.
B: It wasn't that kind of emergency.



A: Our TV remote is filthy.
B: Yes, it's covered with crud.
A: I'm going to clean it.
B: Don't use water on it!
A: I'll use a damp cloth.
B: Don't let water get into any of the cracks.
A: I'll squeeze the cloth so it's almost dry.
B: Don't rub the numbers off the remote.
A: I will rub gently but firmly.
B: Do it quickly, please, so I can change channels during commercials.
A: I'll give it back to you in a couple of minutes.
B: Maybe we should put it in a plastic bag to keep it clean.



A: My ear is killing me.
B: What's the matter?
A: I was on a plane.
B: So?
A: So, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt.
B: That's no good.
A: Sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't.
B: Have you seen a doctor?
A: I've been to two doctors.
B: And they couldn't fix your problem?
A: They both said I have to live with it.
B: Or you can stay off planes.



A: Did you see the woman with the new face?
B: Did she get a nice job?
A: She got an "everything" job!
B: What do you mean?
A: A team of doctors gave her a whole new face.
B: Why did they do that?
A: A mad dog bit most of her face off.
B: Oh, that's terrible. What does she look like now?
A: Her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down.
B: And then will she look normal again?
A: I guess so.
B: God bless modern medicine.



A: What's this stain?
B: I don't know.
A: It looks like blood.
B: I think my nose was bleeding.
A: You should wet your shirt immediately.
B: Why?
A: Because that gets the blood out of the shirt.
B: What's a little blood?
A: Your white shirt is ruined.
B: So, I'll just buy another one.
A: You can wear this one around the house.
B: Next time I'll soak it immediately.



A: I like this hotel.
B: What do you like about it?
A: We get a free breakfast.
B: Coffee and a roll?
A: No, a real breakfast.
B: Bacon and eggs?
A: With toast, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, and juice.
B: Wow! That is nice. Let's stay for two nights.
A: And the rooms are clean, too.
B: Do they allow pets?
A: No pets, no smoking.
B: I like that. Let's stay three nights.



A: I can't believe how long this line is.
B: This is a popular restaurant, isn't it?
A: Yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it?
B: It's the slowest hamburger in town.
A: That's because they cook it while you wait.
B: Yes. That's why it's also the best hamburger in town.
A: A great burger and great service.
B: Yes, the workers are very polite.
A: And they're clean.
B: I've been coming here for years.
A: Me too.
B: Excuse me. They just called my number.



A: Before you go to that interview, check yourself.
B: What's to check?
A: Are your nails clean?
B: Yes, they are.
A: Did you double-check your nose and teeth?
B: They are clean, too.
A: Did you shine your shoes?
B: My shoes are shined.
A: Do your socks match?
B: Of course they match.
A: No, they don't. One is black and one is dark blue.
B: Yikes! Thank you.



A: The election is next week.
B: Who are you voting for?
A: I'm not voting for the mayor.
B: Why not?
A: He made promises that he didn't keep.
B: Like what?
A: He promised to hire 1,000 more police officers.
B: How many did he hire?
A: One hundred!
B: Maybe he had a good reason.
A: Maybe he's just a liar.
B: Maybe I'll vote for someone else, too.



A: This is a great neighborhood.
B: Yes, it is.
A: People are friendly.
B: Yes, they are.
A: The streets and sidewalks are clean.
B: Yes, they are.
A: There's a real nice park nearby.
B: Yes, there is.
A: I feel safe here.
B: There is no crime here.
A: I wish I could move here.
B: Maybe you can, if someone moves out.



A: I bought you a pair of pants.
B: Thank you.
A: I hope they fit.
B: I hope you kept the receipt.
A: You think they won't fit?
B: I think I've put on some weight.
A: You think?
B: Maybe a pound or two.
A: Maybe four or five pounds?
B: My waist is bigger than it was.
A: No problem. These pants have an elastic waistband.
B: You are so smart!



A: We can't afford this house.
B: Are you sure?
A: We will be house rich, but cash poor.
B: What do you mean?
A: Our monthly payments will be too high.
B: We won't have any money for other things?
A: No, we won't have money for gas or food.
B: We'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?
A: Without the peanut butter!
B: That's no good!
A: We have to find a cheaper house.
B: Of course. We can't live without gas or peanut butter.



A: I love cheese.
B: Me too.
A: Where does cheese come from?
B: It comes from cows.
A: So we get cheese from cows, and we get milk, too?
B: Yes, we do.
A: What else do we get from cows?
B: We get hamburgers and steak.
A: Oh, that's so delicious.
B: We also get leather.
A: We get a lot of things from cows, don't we?
B: Yes. A cow is man's best friend.



A: There's something wrong with my right hand.
B: What's wrong with it?
A: It aches most of the time.
B: What do you think it is?
A: I don't know. I think it's old age.
B: If it's old age, why don't both of your hands hurt?
A: That's a good question. Maybe it's not old age.
B: Are you right-handed?
A: Yes. All my life.
B: You're wearing out your right hand. Stop using it so much.
A: But I do all my writing with my right hand.
B: Start typing instead. That way your left hand will do half the work.



A: Lunch was delicious.
B: Thank you.
A: What kind of soup was that?
B: It was tomato soup.
A: That tasted so good.
B: I put lemon and butter in it.
A: The sandwich was good, too.
B: Everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.
A: Especially on toast.
B: And the pickles were great, too.
A: Tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch.
B: I can't wait.



A: The house burned down.
B: What happened?
A: The man fell asleep.
B: Was he smoking?
A: Yes, he was smoking a cigarette.
B: Did he die?
A: Yes, he did. His cat died, too.
B: That's too bad. What about his smoke alarm?
A: The battery was dead.
B: A good battery would have saved his life.
A: He had cigarettes, but no battery.
B: It happens all the time.



A: Do you want to go fishing?
B: Yes. That's a good idea.
A: Where do you want to go?
B: We can go to the river.
A: Or we can go to the lake.
B: Or we can go to the ocean.
A: Let's go to the lake.
B: Yes. The lake is only 10 miles away.
A: We can be there in 20 minutes.
B: I'll get our fishing rods.
A: I'll get the bait.
B: We'll have fresh fish for dinner!



A: I can't believe he won the election.
B: Only 15 percent of the voters turned out.
A: That is a joke.
B: Voting is so important, but people don't bother.
A: Many people think their vote doesn't matter.
B: The mayor won by only 2,000 votes.
A: We're stuck with him for four more years.
B: Voting is so easy. You can even mail your ballot in.
A: All you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.
B: How easy is that?
A: I guess people just don't care.
B: They'll care when they see their taxes go up.



A: I used to work in a deli.
B: How did you like it?
A: I loved it!
B: Did you get free food?
A: I ate free cheese and meat every day.
B: That sounds like a great job.
A: Whatever a customer ordered, I sliced off a little more for me.
B: Did you get fat?
A: No, but I did put on a few pounds.
B: That sounds like a dream job.
A: It was, until one day my manager caught me.
B: No more free cheese for you, huh?



A: I'm not sleeping here tonight.
B: What's the matter? This is a nice room.
A: Maybe the room is nice, but not the bed.
B: What's wrong with the bed?
A: Look at this sheet.
B: Yes?
A: See those stains?
B: I sure do.
A: I'm not sleeping on that sheet.
B: Well, just call the front desk. They'll give us new sheets.
A: I want sheets without stains on them.
B: From now on, let's bring our own sheets.



A: That is a beautiful house.
B: I don't like it.
A: What's the matter with it?
B: It's on the corner.
A: So?
B: That means it gets twice as much traffic.
A: You're right.
B: When you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.
A: Or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.
B: Or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.
A: Let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.
B: That's perfect. The less traffic, the better.



A: My fingers hurt.
B: Why do they hurt?
A: I type too much.
B: You should take a break.
A: I need to type to make money.
B: But typing is causing you pain.
A: Maybe I should see a doctor.
B: Doctors are too expensive.
A: He might tell me to rest for a while.
B: He might want to cut you open.
A: He might say I'm okay.
B: He might say you have bone cancer.



A: What do we need to buy?
B: Let me look at our list.
A: I know that we need milk.
B: Nonfat.
A: Of course. What else?
B: We need cheese, bread, and ham.
A: What kind of cheese?
B: Swiss.
A: Of course, the cheese with holes in it.
B: I never used to buy Swiss cheese.
A: Why not?
B: I didn't want to pay for the holes.



A: Life is hard.
B: It sure is.
A: I thought school was hard.
B: Me, too. I couldn't wait to graduate.
A: But now work is hard, too.
B: I agree. Work is just as hard as school.
A: Sometimes I wish I was back in school.
B: Me, too. School was fun.
A: And it was only 12 years.
B: It went by pretty fast.
A: But work goes on forever!
B: We have to work for 30 years!



A: I'm calling the waiter.
B: What's the matter?
A: This steak has too much fat.
B: What do you want the waiter to do?
A: Bring me a better steak.
B: I wouldn't do that.
A: Why not?
B: They will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it.
A: You're crazy.
B: Then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.
A: Where do you get these crazy ideas?
B: I used to cook in a restaurant!



A: I hate looking for an apartment.
B: Me, too.
A: We have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on Main Street.
B: We'd better get ready to go.
A: It's an upstairs unit.
B: That's good, because I don't want to live under people with loud feet.
A: And it's a corner unit.
B: That's great. We won't have neighbors on both sides of us.
A: No pets are allowed.
B: Perfect. We don't have to listen to barking dogs.
A: And there are only six units in the whole building.
B: Where's the checkbook? I'm ready to rent it without even seeing it.



A: I'm on a new diet.
B: What are you eating now?
A: I switched from pasta to potatoes.
B: Why did you do that?
A: Pasta is processed food. Potatoes are natural food.
B: Natural food has more vitamins.
A: And it's just as easy to prepare.
B: How do you prepare the potatoes?
A: I wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes.
B: That's pretty simple.
A: Then I add butter, salt, and pepper.
B: Can I have all those cans of tomato sauce you bought for your pasta?



A: Well, we have a new president.
B: But we have the same old problems.
A: Well, he's made a few changes.
B: Like what?
A: I think he closed the bowling alley in the White House.
B: Oh, yeah. He's changing it to a basketball court.
A: Who's paying for that?
B: I think we are!
A: Well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.
B: Yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.
A: Do any other world leaders have a basketball court?
B: They will. You know America always leads the way.



A: Baseball is fun.
B: I like to hit the ball.
A: I like to run around the bases.
B: I like to slide into the bases.
A: Yeah. It's a lot of fun to slide.
B: I want to be a baseball player when I grow up.
A: Me too. I want to play for the Yankees.
B: Not me. I want to play for the Dodgers.
A: We have to practice every day.
B: I don't like practice.
A: Me neither. It's boring.
B: But practice makes perfect.



A: I'm sleepy.
B: So am I.
A: I had a long day.
B: So did I.
A: I didn't even have lunch.
B: Neither did I.
A: I was busy the whole day.
B: So was I.
A: I had to bring work home with me.
B: I did too.
A: Your day was just like mine.
B: Of course it was. We work together!



A: They say he has started fifteen big fires.
B: He's been in jail three times already.
A: Why did they ever let him out?
B: It's the law. They can't keep him in jail forever.
A: Why not? Everyone knows he's a firebug. He loves to start fires.
B: I don't know. Sometimes the law doesn't make sense.
A: But his latest fire killed someone.
B: This time they have charged him with murder.
A: So maybe he'll go to jail forever?
B: I sure hope so.
A: Someone should set him on fire.
B: That would teach him a good lesson.



A: I need some pants.
B: I thought you just bought a pair.
A: I did.
B: What's wrong with them so soon?
A: The pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.
B: You shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.
A: But that's what pockets are for.
B: You should carry them in a purse.
A: I'm a man, and men don't carry purses!
B: Well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets.
A: I would if I could find someone who makes strong pockets.
B: Try a Google search online.



A: What time does your plane leave?
B: It leaves at 12:15.
A: When do you have to be at the airport?
B: I have to be there two hours early.
A: So we have to be at the airport at 10:15.
B: That means we have to leave the house at 9:15.
A: Well, it's an hour to get there, if there are no traffic problems.
B: So maybe we better leave at 8:15?
A: Yes, it's better to get there too early than too late.
B: I agree.
A: You never know what might happen on these freeways.
B: There's at least one huge accident every day.



A: What did the doctor say?
B: He thinks I have too much stress.
A: Stress causes your stomachaches?
B: Stress causes different problems with different people.
A: So what did he tell you to do?
B: He said I need to think positive.
A: He didn't give you any medication?
B: I hate medication. It makes me feel different.
A: So how do you think positive?
B: I think about nice things.
A: Like what?
B: Like a day at the beach, with my toes in the sand.



A: I need to fly to New York.
B: When are you going?
A: During the Christmas holidays.
B: You'd better buy your ticket now.
A: You must be kidding.
B: No, I'm not. It's March. Time is running out. Seats are selling out right now.
A: I thought I would wait until October.
B: I'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during Christmas.
A: You're right.
B: Well, listen to me. You need to buy a ticket now.
A: But maybe prices will be cheaper in October.
B: Cheaper prices won't do you any good if there are no seats.



A: I cut my finger.
B: How did you do that?
A: It's a paper cut.
B: Paper can be dangerous.
A: It hurts, too.
B: Paper cuts can hurt a lot.
A: Where are the band-aids?
B: I think they're in the medicine cabinet.
A: It's on the tip of my finger.
B: A band-aid might not work.
A: I must not use this finger until the cut heals.
B: It might take a day or two to heal.



A: People say that everybody loves Obama.
B: Well, more than 50 million people voted for McCain.
A: That's 50 million people who don't love Obama.
B: Obama's got four years to make everyone happy.
A: He's never going to make everyone happy.
B: Can you imagine being President?
A: Everyone wants you to solve their problems.
B: I have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.
A: You and everybody else.
B: I would never want to be President.
A: But think about all the power you'd have.
B: I prefer my quiet little life to all the power in the world.



A: My girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.
B: Why was that?
A: I sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before I tasted it.
B: What's the matter with that?
A: Her mom is a great cook.
B: So, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything.
A: It hurt her feelings.
B: Oh.
A: I apologized to her, but I could tell she was still upset.
B: Maybe you shouldn't eat there again.
A: I'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.
B: It's your girlfriend's fault. She should have warned you.



A: Let's leave.
B: But we just got here.
A: Did you see the waiter's hands?
B: No.
A: He had dirty fingernails.
B: Really?
A: His nails were black!
B: That's disgusting.
A: And he poured water into our glasses.
B: Yuck! No water for me.
A: I wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too.
B: Who cares? Let's get out of here.



A: Put your seatbelt on.
B: Why?
A: Because it will protect you in case of an accident.
B: But it's uncomfortable.
A: It's the law.
B: It's so much trouble.
A: It's common sense.
B: It's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.
A: Hold your breath till we get there.
B: Okay, my seatbelt is on.
A: I'm glad you don't complain very much.
B: I'm ready for an accident.



A: Did you call the manager?
B: Yes. He said he'd come over tomorrow.
A: Did he say what time?
B: Yes. He said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.
A: Did he understand what the problem is?
B: Yes. I told him our doorbell doesn't work.
A: It shouldn't take him long to fix it.
B: I don't even know why we need to fix it.
A: In case we have visitors.
B: But they can just knock on the door.
A: Actually, I want him to look at our carpet, too.
B: Yes, it would be nice if he'd give us a new carpet.



A: I don't like my job.
B: What do you do?
A: I'm a babysitter.
B: Is that a lot of work?
A: Babies cry all the time.
B: You have to change their diapers.
A: I have to feed them.
B: Are you looking for another job?
A: No, I'm looking for another family.
B: Another family?
A: A family with only one baby.
B: That's a good idea.



A: Let's go jogging.
B: That's a good idea.
A: I bought some new shoes.
B: Are they comfortable?
A: They're very comfortable.
B: How much were they?
A: They were on sale for $80.
B: Do they help you run faster?
A: No, but my feet don't hurt anymore.
B: Then they're worth every penny.
A: You might want to buy a pair.
B: I'll wait until I wear this pair out.



A: What are those wipes for?
B: You use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.
A: That's a great idea.
B: Yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers.
A: I'm going to take five wipes.
B: What do you need five of them for?
A: One to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce.
B: What's the matter with the produce?
A: Do you think the bananas fell from the sky?
B: What do you mean?
A: I mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges.
B: Well, you better save a wipe for the dirty dollar bills you're going to pay with.



A: Did you read this article?
B: What article?
A: It says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.
B: Only 11 percent?
A: About 50 percent of the time he's traveling.
B: Where does he travel to?
A: Oh, all over the world.
B: But he's supposed to be making our city a better place.
A: He's visiting other cities to get ideas.
B: Can't he just go online?
A: The rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.
B: Well, he'll never get reelected once this news gets out.



A: Do you like this house?
B: Yes, it's beautiful.
A: It's perfect for us and the kids.
B: Three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard.
A: And we can afford it!
B: So are we going to buy it?
A: I'm afraid not.
B: It's too far from your job, isn't it?
A: I can't spend four hours on the road every day.
B: By the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat.
A: I won't be able to play with the kids.
B: No, we have to find something closer to your job.



A: Do you smell that?
B: Oh, yes.
A: I can't stand cigarette smoke.
B: It smells so bad.
A: One cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.
B: Smokers think they are so cool.
A: They are so weak.
B: A little cigarette controls them.
A: They look so stupid taking a puff.
B: And then they blow smoke out of their mouth.
A: They think it's cool.
B: Cigarettes stink.



A: I hate flying.
B: So do I.
A: A long time ago, flying used to be okay.
B: Now it's like riding a bus.
A: You're jammed in with people all around you.
B: Half of them are coughing, and the other half are sneezing.
A: You don't have any elbow room or knee room.
B: People are always getting up to use the bathroom.
A: Kids are crying or climbing over you.
B: It's a flying zoo!
A: I wish I could afford first class seats.
B: Doesn't everybody?



A: I need a job.
B: What was your last job?
A: I was a painter.
B: What happened?
A: I got laid off because there was no work.
B: What else can you do?
A: I'm a handyman.
B: Can you fix a dripping faucet in a kitchen sink?
A: Of course.
B: Then I have a job for you in my kitchen.
A: It will cost you only $20 plus parts.
B: Okay. That sounds like a fair price.



A: This hot bread is delicious.
B: I like this restaurant because they give you free bread.
A: Well, I think we are paying for it.
B: No. Look at the bill when we get it. There's no charge for the bread.
A: It is delicious, especially with butter.
B: I think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.
A: They probably wouldn't like that.
B: I'm eating so much bread that I'm getting full.
A: Then stop eating the bread!
B: Okay, just one more piece. Pass the butter, please.
A: If I owned a restaurant, I would never serve hot bread before the main course.
B: That's terrible. I would never go to your restaurant.



A: Tiger is the greatest golfer in the world.
B: You can say that again.
A: But I'm worried about Tiger.
B: Why is that?
A: Because he likes to SCUBA dive.
B: What's wrong with that?
A: It can be dangerous.
B: You mean he could drown.
A: He shouldn't SCUBA dive until he retires.
B: But he dives to relax.
A: He might relax, but it makes me nervous.
B: If his wife doesn't mind, you shouldn't mind.



A: I eat the same thing every day.
B: You're kidding.
A: No, I'm serious.
B: Doesn't that get old?
A: No, because I'm eating food that I like.
B: But the same thing day after day gets old.
A: Well, I guess if it ever does get old, I'll change to something different.
B: Do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?
A: No, I hate vegetables.
B: But you eat fruits.
A: I eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day.
B: Well, there's nothing wrong with that.



A: Did you go to the 99 Cents store?
B: Yes, I did.
A: What did you buy?
B: Well, I got a lot of good deals, as usual.
A: Like what?
B: Well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.
A: That's a good deal.
B: And a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.
A: Another good deal.
B: But the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.
A: I don't know how that store makes money.
B: Neither do I, but they're doing something right.



A: What are you doing?
B: I'm going to change the light bulb. It burnt out.
A: What are you standing on?
B: A couple of dictionaries and some textbooks.
A: Are you crazy?
B: What's the matter?
A: Those books will slip and you'll fall.
B: It's only a couple of feet.
A: What if you fall while you're holding the light bulb, and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes?
B: I never thought about that.
A: You'd be blind for the rest of your life!
B: I'll get the stepladder.



A: There's something wrong with my orange.
B: What's wrong?
A: It's not orange!
B: Your orange isn't orange?
A: No, it's dark pink!
B: Are you sure? I never heard of such a thing.
A: I just peeled it, and I'm looking at it right now.
B: Let me see. Yes, you're right. Your orange is pink.
A: Who ever heard of such a thing?
B: Oh, look. Here's the little sticker that was on it. It's called a Pink Navel.
A: What is this world coming to?
B: Who knows? Maybe soon we'll have pink bananas.



A: Did you see that puddle of water on the floor?
B: Yes. I called for a clean-up.
A: A puddle of water is very dangerous.
B: It isn't easy to see.
A: But it's real easy to slip on.
B: Especially on these slick floors.
A: Someone who slips could hurt their back.
B: They could even crack their head open.
A: We should stand here till the clean-up person gets here.
B: We can leave if we put an orange cone here.
A: Yes, but I don't know where the orange cones are.
B:  It doesn't matter. Here he comes now with the mop.



A: Is this a clean restaurant?
B: Well, the tables and chairs look okay.
A: Okay, let's sit down.
B: Check out the silverware.
A: It passes inspection.
B: Here comes the waiter. See if his hands and nails are clean.
A: Well, the waiter looked clean, so I guess it's okay to eat here.
B: You're forgetting about the bathroom.
A: I'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.
B: You're not going to examine it before we order dinner?
A: No, I'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because I'm pretty hungry right now.
B: Me, too. Let's forget about germs and focus on food.



A: Boy, it's chilly outside, isn't it?
B: It sure is.
A: In fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too.
B: Let's turn on the heat.
A: I'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.
B: It should be warmer in a few minutes.
A: It's so nice to have a heated apartment.
B: How did they survive in the old days?
A: They had fireplaces.
B: Someone had to chop the wood.
A: And carry it into the house.
B: All we have to do is flip a switch.



A: Do you have a cold?
B: Yes, I do.
A: How did you get it?
B: My sister had a cold. She gave it to me.
A: Have you taken anything for your cold?
B: No, I just blow my nose a lot.
A: Your nose is stopped up?
B: Yes. I have to breathe through my mouth.
A: Have you tried nose drops?
B: No, I don't like nose drops.
A: They work great.
B: I don't care. I don't like to put drops in my nose.



A: I need a new computer.
B: What's the matter with yours?
A: It's six years old.
B: That's pretty old.
A: It still works, but I'm going to give it to a charity.
B: Are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?
A: Oh, a laptop, of course.
B: A PC or a Mac?
A: I haven't decided yet.
B: More and more people are using Macs.
A: But 90 percent of the world uses PCs.
B: And that's not going to change anytime soon.



A: Some guy rowed across the Atlantic Ocean.
B: Good for him.
A: Why would he do that?
B: Did he set a new record?
A: Yes, I think he did.
B: Well, I guess that's why he did it.
A: What's the point?
B: Now he has the world record!
A: But someone's going to break it, so what good is it?
B: Well, he can enjoy it while it lasts.
A: I don't think he even got paid for it.
B: Some people do it just to do it.



A: Who did you vote for for president?
B: I voted for Ralph Nader.
A: Who in the world is Ralph Nader?
B: He's the best man for president.
A: Why's that?
B: He hates corporations.
A: Well, most corporations do think only about money.
B: He hates Democrats and Republicans.
A: Well, they do put their party before their country.
B: He's the only candidate that I trust.
A: But he didn't have a chance. Nobody voted for him!
B: Sooner or later, voters will wake up.



A: What would you do if you lost your job?
B: I have no idea. I've been here for 20 years.
A: Do you have any other skills?
B: Well, I know how to flip hamburgers.
A: No one would hire you to flip hamburgers.
B: Have you heard something that you're not telling me?
A: What do you mean?
B: Are there going to be layoffs at this place?
A: I certainly hope not!
B: If you got laid off, you'd be flipping hamburgers, too.
A: Oh great, we could both work at Burger King.
B: Maybe we'd get laid off there, too.



A: Did you watch that golf tournament?
B: The one that Tiger won?
A: How did he do it?
B: It was nothing for him.
A: He sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!
B: He sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.
A: I think he is from outer space.
B: No human could possibly play golf that well.
A: Whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot.
B: No human can do that.
A: Somebody should check his birth record.
B: I bet it says he was born on Mars.



A: I want to go on a cruise ship.
B: That sounds like fun. Where do you want to go?
A: I want to cruise to Hawaii.
B: That should be a nice trip. Lots of fun, and lots of food.
A: I have no idea how much it will cost.
B: I think it depends on the season and on your cabin.
A: Well, of course I want to go when the weather is nice.
B: Yes, you don't want to travel in winter storms.
A: And I want to get a big cabin with a view.
B: Are you going to travel alone?
A: No, my sister and I will travel together.
B: Well, you should go online and try to find a good deal.



A: Who's the greatest baseball player?
B: There are so many great players.
A: Yes, but who is the greatest?
B: I'd have to say Babe Ruth.
A: Most people would say that.
B: He changed the game.
A: Yes, he made the home run popular.
B: Everybody loved him, all over the nation.
A: He helped make the Yankees the best team ever.
B: And Ruth was a good person, too.
A: He always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.
B: There will never be another Babe.



A: I got ripped off.
B: What happened?
A: I had a car problem, so I went online.
B: Did you find a solution?
A: Yes, I did. A site I went to said they would send me the solution.
B: So, what's the problem?
A: I sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution.
B: What are you going to do?
A: I sent them an email asking for my money back.
B: Have you heard from them?
A: Not yet. It's been a week.
B: Well, I guess that's a $20 lesson for you.



A: Have you seen our waiter?
B: Here he comes now.
A: We've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.
B: Oops, I guess I was wrong. That isn't our waiter.
A: We can give him five more minutes, and then leave.
B: I'll go up front and talk to the manager.
A: That's a good idea.
B: Maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.
A: Maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.
B: Every time we eat out, it's an adventure.
A: Last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.
B: We'll never go there again.



A: Do your students ever talk about their jobs?
B: Yes, and they ask me what jobs are the best.
A: I tell my students to become a teacher.
B: Teaching is a great job.
A: It's the best job I've ever had.
B: What makes it so good?
A: For me, it's the students.
B: What do you mean?
A: I mean I have wonderful students.
B: That must be nice.
A: Teaching is the best part of my whole day.
B: You're a lucky man to have a job you love.



A: I love peanuts.
B: Me, too. I love them roasted and salted.
A: I love boiled peanuts.
B: Boiled? I never heard of that.
A: Just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.
B: I'll have to try them sometime.
A: They're best when they're hot.
B: My brother is allergic to peanuts.
A: That's not good.
B: No, it isn't. He almost died when he was little.
A: I guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.
B: He has a very strict diet.



A: This is a nice neighborhood.
B: The streets are clean and quiet.
A: The neighbors don't party on the weekends.
B: People take care of their lawns.
A: No rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.
B: We never have to call the police about anything.
A: Our kids are completely safe.
B: So why are we selling our house?
A: They're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.
B: So we've got to sell before property values go down?
A: Yes. I still can't believe our city council allowed this building.
B: They're probably getting something under the table.



A: Would you put suntan lotion on my back, please?
B: Sure.
A: Thank you.
B: You shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.
A: I want to get a tan. I don't want to look so pale.
B: What's wrong with looking pale?
A: People think you might be sick.
B: Who thinks that?
A: I don't know.
B: It's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.
A: I know that.
B: So why are you arguing with me? Don't lie in the sun too long!



A: What happens when the fire alarm rings?
B: We tell our students to leave the classroom.
A: Can they take their belongings?
B: Yes, if they do it quickly.
A: Where do the students go?
B: They go out to the north parking lot.
A: What do the teachers do?
B: We take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll.
A: Why do you do that?
B: We want to make sure all the students are out of the building.
A: If they are all outside, then what?
B: Then we just wait outside for a fireman to tell us to go back in.



A: I don't know why I bother to vote.
B: Why's that?
A: What good does it do?
B: You get to put someone in power that you like.
A: Only if my candidate wins.
B: Well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him.
A: But even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises.
B: That's true. They promise anything just so they get elected.
A: And when elected, they go their own way.
B: They forget who put them in power.
A: They forget where they came from.
B: Maybe you should run for office.



A: Is this table okay?
B: No, it's too close to the kitchen door.
A: How about this table?
B: No, it's too close to the front door.
A: This looks like a nice table.
B: No, it's too close to the salad bar.
A: Okay, I give up.
B: Well, there is one good table.
A: Great. Which one?
B: That one. A group of eight just sat down at it.



A: I'm gaining weight.
B: How much have you gained?
A: Three pounds just this month.
B: Do you know why?
A: I think it's the ice cream.
B: You started eating ice cream?
A: It was on sale.
B: How much did you buy?
A: I filled up my freezer with ice cream.
B: Well, it won't last forever.
A: No, I figure I'll finish it all by next week.
B: Then you can start losing weight, if there isn't another sale.



A: I have to go back upstairs.
B: Why? We're already late.
A: I have to check the stove.
B: What's the matter?
A: Maybe I left the burner on.
B: No, you didn't. I checked the stove before we left.
A: Are you sure?
B: Of course I'm sure.
A: Well, I have to go back upstairs anyway.
B: It's getting later every minute.
A: I think I left the water running.
B: No, you didn't. Let's go! The only thing running is the clock!



A: That election for U.S. Senator stunk.
B: What do you mean?
A: There were more votes than voters!
B: But that's impossible.
A: Officials said that it's possible.
B: Did they explain how it's possible?
A: No. They said there are some things you can't explain.
B: So are they going to hold another election?
A: No. That will cost too much money.
B: So it's better to save money than to have an honest election?
A: Well, the Democratic Party says it was an honest election.
B: Of course they say that their man won!



A: Boy, I'm glad that job is finished.
B: How long did it take?
A: Four hours, without a break.
B: It's always nice to finish a job.
A: Well, it's good and bad.
B: What's bad about it?
A: When you finish, all you do is start another job!
B: Yes, that's right. It does get boring.
A: Especially if it's the same work, over and over.
B: But that's what most people do.
A: Yes, I guess most of us are stuck in a routine.
B: I wonder if there is any job that you don't repeat over and over.



A: I hate to fly.
B: Because of all the security?
A: No, because it hurts my ears.
B: What do you mean?
A: Every time we land or take off, my ears hurt so much.
B: That's just the altitude change, I think.
A: Whatever it is, it hurts.
B: Can't you take medicine or something for it?
A: I've tried everything, but nothing works.
B: Have you tried earplugs?
A: They don't work, either.
B: Well, be glad you're not a pilot.



A: I can't quit smoking.
B: Of course you can.
A: I don't have enough will power.
B: Of course you do.
A: I wish I had never started.
B: So does every smoker.
A: I've tried to quit so many times.
B: So has everyone else.
A: Nothing seems to work.
B: All it takes is will power, and you have it.
A: Then why can't I quit?
B: You have to believe in yourself.



A: Where's the pencil sharpener?
B: Which one?
A: Any one. I need to sharpen this pencil.
B: I think there's one on the dining room table.
A: I already looked there.
B: Did you look in the desk drawer?
A: Yes, I looked there, too.
B: Don't we have about five sharpeners?
A: Yes, but they seem to have legs.
B: Tomorrow I'm going to buy an electric sharpener.
A: Get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.
B: Yes. That way it will stay where I put it.



A: Did you hear what happened at the baseball game?
B: No, please tell me.
A: Someone punched out someone.
B: That's not nice.
A: It's worse than that.
B: How so?
A: Two guys got into an argument.
B: I'll bet they were drinking.
A: A third guy punched one of the two guys.
B: I'll bet he was drinking, too.
A: The victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.
B: That's terrible. Can't people just have fun at a baseball game?



A: That was a huge fire in Santa Barbara.
B: Yes, it was.
A: They said about 30 houses burned to the ground.
B: And they were expensive houses.
A: I feel so sorry for those people.
B: Why feel sorry for rich people?
A: I feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.
B: So do I, but not if they're rich.
A: What does that have to do with it?
B: Rich people think they're better than us.
A: How many rich people do you know?
B: None.
