How arethings going with you and your roommate?
Jon:
Not verywell.  We're supposed to share the groceries, but I end up feeding him three meals aday.  My grocery bill is huge, you know.  I really can't afford it anylonger. 
Terri:
I know how you feel.  I used to have a roommate like that.  He neveroffered to reimburse me for anything. 
Jon:
I'mreally fed up with his freeloading, but I just don't know how to tell him that he shouldcome up with half the grocery bill, because sometimes he treats me to a meal in arestaurant.
Terri:
Well, honesty is the best policy.  Maybe you just want to have aheart-to-heart, friend-to-friend talk with him.  If he refuses to mend his ways, thenask him to move out.  You can't let him wear out his welcome.
