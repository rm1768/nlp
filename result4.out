B: Don't worry about what people think.



A: I had the worst date the other night.

B: That's dangerous.
A: I thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.
B: What happened at the restaurant?
A: We had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!
B: I guess you can't go back to that restaurant.

A: Last week they told us about a bear in a back yard.
B: Last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant.

A: My laptop is so slow.
B: Buy a new one.
A: I would if I had the money.
B: Why is it so slow?
A: That's a good question.
B: Did you take it to a computer shop?
A: I would if I had the money.
B: Well, I guess you have to live with it.
A: Sometimes I want to throw it out the window.
B: You don't want to do that.
A: Why not?
B: You might hit someone in the head.



A: Parking at school is impossible.
B: I'll say.
A: I drove around for half an hour.
B: Did you find a spot?
A: I found a spot, but someone cut in and took it from me.
B: Did you yell at them?
A: Yes, I did.
B: And?
A: And he yelled back at me.
B: How rude.
A: But I got lucky a few minutes later.
B: You have to be lucky to find a parking space.



A: I don't like that man.
B: Why not?
A: He's a dirty old man.
B: What do you mean?
A: He's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.
B: Well, you can't blame a man for asking.
A: He should act his age.
B: But a lot of old people are still interested in dating.
A: They should find a nice hobby.
B: Just wait until you're 50 years old.
A: Dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.
B: That's what you say now. Wait till you're 50.



A: I love my computer.
B: Computers are so cool.
A: I love to go online.
B: The Internet is amazing.
A: You can travel all over the world.

A: What did you do?
B: I stood on the Great Wall and looked all around.
A: What was it like?
B: It was like the real thing.
A: It was like being there?
B: Yes, I felt like I was actually there.



A: Look at this traffic.
B: I'd rather not.
A: It gets worse every year.
B: Why are you complaining? We're going almost 20 miles an hour.
A: The speed limit is 65!
B: Well, that's between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.
A: Where are all these people going?
B: They're all asking the same question.
A: When are they going to fix this problem?
B: They said they need more money.
A: They always need more money.
B: It'll get worse before it gets better.



A: Did you see that car?
B: Yes, he went through the red light.
A: Can we call the police?
B: No, the police don't care.
A: Why not?
B: They have to see it happen.
A: They don't believe us?
B: No. They can only give a ticket if they see it happen.
A: So, what do we do?
B: We don't do anything.
A: Maybe we should honk the horn next time.
B: The driver will just honk back at us.



A: Does your girlfriend ever make you angry?
B: Sometimes.
A: What does she do?
B: Just yesterday, I told her I wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.
A: That was a nice thing to say.
B: That's what I thought.
A: What did she say?
B: She laughed! She didn't believe me.
A: That wasn't very nice of her.
B: She said that nothing is more important to me than money.
A: What did you say?
B: I told her I wouldn't trade her for any other woman in the world.



A: This is a huge library.
B: Yes, it has lots of rooms and lots of space.
A: And lots of books.
B: And lots of thieves.
A: What do you mean?
B: I mean, keep your belongings close to you.
A: The only thing in my backpack is used books.
B: But thieves don't know that.
A: They might think that I've got an iPod or laptop in there.
B: Now you're thinking.
A: You'd think a library would be safe from thieves.
B: Not even a church is safe from thieves.



A: Let's go to a movie.
B: I'd rather not.
A: Why not?
B: You know I don't like crowds.
A: Let's go to an early movie.
B: Okay, that won't be very crowded.
A: What would you like to see?
B: Oh, I don't care. You're the one who wants to go out.
A: Well, I want to see "The Pursuit of Happyness."
B: What have you heard about it?
A: It's based on a true story about a divorced man and his young son.
B: Well, I hope it has a happy ending.



A: We need to save money.
B: Why do we need to save money?
A: Because we need to buy a house.
B: But a house is so expensive.
A: That's why we need to save money.
B: How much do we need to save?
A: We need to save enough for a down payment.
B: How much is that?
A: That's about $30,000.
B: Thirty thousand dollars! That will take forever.
A: Not if we save every penny.
B: Okay. Here's seven pennies.



A: How good is your math?
B: I can add two and two.
A: So you're not very good at math?
B: I'm terrible at math.
A: Well, I need some help.
B: With what?
A: I'm taking a math course in school.
B: Well, you should ask your teacher or your classmates for help.
A: I can't do that.
B: Why not?
A: They might think I'm stupid.
B: They're not going to think that! They'll be glad to help you.



A: My car is dirty.
B: Why don't you wash it?
A: That's what I'm going to do.
B: Are you going to wash it yourself?
A: Of course. It's not a hard job.
B: I'll help you.
A: Okay, I'll get a bucket.
B: I'll rinse the car first.
A: Then we can scrub it with a wet sponge and soap.
B: After that, we can dry it with a towel.
A: Then it will look like new
B: And you save $10.



A: The ocean is so big.
B: You can't see the end of it.

A: That's your favorite thing to do?
B: Well, it's one of them.
A: Where do you go to watch people?
B: My girlfriend and I sit outside Starbucks.
A: That sounds like a good spot.
B: We watch people walk by with their dogs.
A: I guess you see lots of different dogs.
B: We don't even know what kind most of them are.
A: There are lots of different kinds, but they all have one thing in common.
B: Yes, they love to sniff each other when they meet.



A: Do you believe in God?
B: Of course.
A: Do you pray to God?
B: Occasionally.
A: When's that?
B: When I need something.
A: Like what?
B: Well, if I have a big test at school.
A: Does God answer your prayers?
B: Yes, I've passed all my tests.
A: Do you ever pray for money?
B: Not yet. I won't need to do that until I graduate from high school.



A: It sure is windy today.
B: Paper is flying everywhere.
A: This wind is dangerous for drivers.
B: Especially for drivers of big trucks.
A: The wind blows those trucks over.
B: It blows trees over, too.
A: A tree fell onto my dad's car.
B: Was there much damage?
A: My dad had to buy a new car.
B: Wow! That's terrible.
A: Never park your car under a tree.
B: The wind will get you, or the birds will get you.



A: I'm upset with my mom.
B: Why is that?
A: I warned her about her new boyfriend. She didn't listen to me.
B: What happened?
A: I gave her $1,000 for her birthday. I told her to spend it on herself.
B: That was very nice of you.
A: I found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend.
B: Why did she do that?
A: He said he would buy her a nice ring.
B: What's wrong with that?
A: He went to Las Vegas. He lost it all gambling.
B: I hope your mom broke up with him.



A: They call him Father Dollar Bill.
B: Yes, he was on the TV news today.
A: Every Easter Sunday he gives away money.
B: Is it his money?
A: No. Movie stars give him money to give to homeless people.
B: How much money does he give away?
A: This year he gave away $15,000.
B: That's a lot of money.
A: He gave $100 to people in wheelchairs.
B: What about the other homeless people?
A: They got $1 each.
B: People stood in line just to get one dollar?!



A: The cops finally found the husband.
B: What husband?
A: The husband of the driver who ran over two college students at 3 a.m.
B: Oh, yeah. The girl died instantly, and the boy is still in the hospital.
A: The husband said he tried to help the boy.
B: Yes, he pushed him off the hood of the car.
A: No, he said he gently placed the boy on the street.
B: So what? They still drove off.
A: The husband said a fire department was nearby.
B: So what? Did he dial 911?
A: He said he was thinking about it, but he didn't get around to it.
B: He didn't get around to turning himself in, either.



A: When are we going to stop?
B: We'll stop at the next McDonald's.
A: How far away is that?
B: I think we'll be there in half an hour.
A: I hope so. I have to go to the bathroom.
B: Well, I can always pull over.
A: No, thank you, I'll just wait.
B: We can kill two birds with one stone.
A: What do you mean?
B: While you're using the bathroom, I'll order some food.
A: Don't order for me. I'm not hungry.
B: I'm very hungry. I'll order for you, and then I'll eat yours.



A: This is such a long light.
B: Look how many cars are waiting in line.
A: They need a left-turn arrow.
B: Only two cars can make a left turn every three or four minutes.
A: We'll be here forever.
B: Get out of this lane.
A: But we need to turn left.
B: Forget it. Go straight.
A: Then what?
B: Then we'll just make a U-turn.
A: And then we can turn right at the light.
B: Good idea. It will be so much quicker.



A: Old movies are the best.
B: Even though they're in black and white.
A: A good story is more important than color.
B: Actors didn't curse back then.
A: And there was no violence.
B: People today don't like that.
A: No, today people like lots of action.
B: I like a good story.
A: I like to see actors who are like real people.
B: Like real people with real problems.
A: They still make movies like that.
B: Yes, but they never make much money.



A: Do animals talk to each other?
B: Of course they talk to each other.
A: What do they talk about?
B: They talk about other animals.
A: What else do they talk about?
B: They talk about food and the weather.
A: Do they talk about us?
B: Of course they talk about us.
A: What do they say about us?
B: They say that we are funny-looking.
A: Ha! We're not funny-looking; animals are funny-looking.
B: We're funny-looking because we wear clothes.



A: I need a cheap car.
B: How much money do you have?
A: $1,000.
B: Well, that should get you something.
A: But I need something that's reliable.
B: You need a car with low mileage.
A: A car that was owned by a little old lady.
B: Where have you looked?
A: I haven't looked anywhere yet.
B: Why not?
A: Because I'll never find one for such a low price.
B: You're right about that. Keep saving your money.



A: I have to clean the house.
B: Yes, it's very dirty.
A: You can help me.
B: Why me?
A: Because you helped make it dirty.
B: What do you want me to do?
A: I want you to clean the bathroom.
B: Oh, that's easy.
A: Clean the sink, the tub, the counter, and the toilet.
B: That's a lot of work.
A: Tell me when you finish.
B: I don't think so. You'll just give me more work.



A: Do you get PBS on TV?
B: Yes, everybody gets the Public Broadcasting System.
A: It puts me to sleep.
B: Tell me about it.
A: A gardening show follows a knitting show.
B: A cooking show follows a sewing show.
A: A travel show follows another travel show.
B: I'll say! I've gone around the world a dozen times already!
A: Now they're adding old TV shows to the old movies.
B: I sure would like to see something interesting for a change.
A: If more people donate money, PBS could offer new shows.
B: Who wants to donate? Public TV should be free.



A: Good afternoon, officer.
B: Your driver's license and registration, please.
A: Here you go.
B: Do you know why I pulled you over?
A: I have no idea. All of a sudden I heard your siren.
B: You rolled through that stop sign back there.
A: But I stopped!
B: No, you didn't. You slowed down, but you didn't come to a full stop.
A: Well, nobody else does, so why should I?
B: That's not the attitude of a good driver.
A: But I am a good driver. I've never had a ticket in my life.
B: Well, you've got one now. Here. Have a nice day.



A: You're watching too much TV.
B: What do you mean?
A: I mean you're wasting your life.
B: I'm having fun.
A: You're sitting there with your mouth open.
B: Who cares?
A: I care. Do something.
B: Okay. I did something.
A: What did you do?
B: I turned up the volume.
A: That's not what I meant by "do something."
B: Will you do something? Leave me alone.



A: I love to watch "Judge Judy."
B: Is that a TV show?
A: Yes. It's on every afternoon.
B: What's so good about it?
A: They have interesting lawsuits.
B: Such as?
A: Yesterday, a woman complained about a cell phone she bought on eBay.
B: Was something wrong with the phone?
A: It works only in Canada.
B: Did the seller know that?
A: Yes, and he didn't tell the buyer.
B: I hope Judge Judy made the seller take the phone back.



A: That woman is a very good singer.
B: Yes, but she looks like a man.
A: What difference does it make?
B: Female singers are supposed to be pretty.
A: Singers are supposed to sound good.
B: They should look good, too.
A: There are lots of ugly men singers.
B: Men singers don't have to look good.
A: Then neither do women singers.
B: Well, I would never buy her CD.
A: But you would buy her CD if she was pretty?
B: Yes. I would buy all of her CDs.



A: $140. I can't believe it.
B: What are you talking about?
A: I got a ticket downtown for $140.
B: Were you speeding?
A: No, I was crossing the street.
B: Were you jaywalking?
A: No, I was in the crosswalk.
B: So why did you get a ticket?
A: The officer said the red hand was blinking.
B: Was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk?
A: No, the white WALK sign was blinking.
B: You should fight that ticket. I'll be your witness.



A: Did you write a letter to grandma?
B: Yes, I did.
A: Did you tell her about school?
B: I told her that school is fun.
A: Did you put the letter in an envelope?
B: Yes, and I sealed the envelope.
A: Did you put a stamp on the envelope?
B: I couldn't find any stamps.
A: They're in the kitchen drawer.
B: Okay. I just put a stamp on the envelope.
A: Give me the envelope, and I'll mail it for you.
B: When is grandma going to learn about e-mail?



A: Let's play cards.
B: I don't know any card games.
A: I'll teach you one.
B: Okay. What will you teach me?
A: It's called poker.
B: Is it easy to learn?
A: Yes, it will only take about 30 minutes.
B: Okay. Teach me how to play.
A: We each get five cards.
B: Oh, look. I have four tens.
A: That's great, but you're not supposed to tell me.
B: Oh. Sorry. Okay, I don't have four tens.



A: I lost my new pen.
B: Where did you lose it?
A: I don't know.
B: When did you lose it?
A: I think I lost it today. I used it yesterday.
B: Did you check all your pockets?
A: I checked all my pockets.
B: Did you look in your desk?
A: Yes. It isn't there, either.
B: It's probably around somewhere.
A: Oh, well, it only cost me a dollar.
B: Only a dollar? Don't even look for it.



A: I don't like riding the bus.
B: Why not?
A: Number one, it's too slow.
B: You're right. A car is faster.
A: Number two, it's usually late.
B: You're right. The buses are never on time.
A: Number three, it doesn't run 24 hours.
B: You're right. Buses don't run late at night.
A: Number four, it's too crowded.
B: You're right. You have to stand in the aisle.
A: Number five, it's unsafe.
B: You're right. Bad guys might rob you.



A: Do you have a car?
B: Yes, I do.
A: What kind of car do you have?
B: I have a Honda.
A: Is it new?
B: It was new in 2003.
A: So, it's pretty old now.
B: Yes, it is. But it still looks good.
A: Do you take good care of it?
B: Oh, yes. I wash it once a week.
A: Do you change the oil?
B: My mechanic changes the oil twice a year.



A: I think you're very pretty.
B: Thank you.
A: Would you have dinner with me?
B: I would like to.
A: Can I pick you up Friday night?
B: What time?
A: Eight o'clock.
B: That sounds great.
A: We'll go to a French restaurant.
B: I've never been to a French restaurant.
A: I think you'll love the food.
B: I'm not going to eat any snails!



A: Why are you yawning?
B: I'm sleepy.
A: Why don't you go to bed?
B: I want to watch this TV show.
A: Maybe you should record it.
B: The tape recorder is broken.
A: Then you should watch the rerun.
B: Why? I'm watching the original.
A: But you'll be asleep in about one minute.
B: I'm just yawning because the commercials are on.
A: Okay. I'll tell you how the show ends.
B: Zzz.



A: All the TV stations are going to go digital.
B: Yes, that will occur next month.
A: Most of them are already broadcasting in digital.
B: The digital signal is very clear.
A: Oh, no, it isn't!
B: What do you mean?
A: I can't get a single channel.
B: Do you have a digital TV?
A: Of course. But I don't have cable.
B: You don't need to have cable, but you do need a good antenna.
A: But I have rabbit ears.
B: Rabbit ears aren't strong enough. Buy a digital antenna.



A: They were in a crosswalk near school at 3 a.m.
B: Who?
A: Two students from USC.
B: What happened?
A: A speeding car ran a red light, killing the girl.
B: What happened to the other student?
A: He landed on the hood of the car.
B: Did he get off the hood?
A: No, the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the hood.
B: I'll bet the car continued on its way.
A: Of course it did. Why stop after you've run over two people?
B: I hope they find them and put them in jail for life.



A: What happened to your car?
B: I got a dent in the parking lot.
A: How did you get it?
B: I don't know. Maybe it was from a shopping cart.
A: Those shopping carts are dangerous.
B: Especially the metal ones.
A: I don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts.
B: That's a good idea, but there was a good sale at this store.
A: Did you save any money on the sale?
B: Yes, I did. I saved about $50.
A: That's great.
B: Yes, except this dent will cost about $150.



A: It's Sunday.
B: So?
A: You know what that means.
B: I forgot.
A: Sunday means we go to church.
B: Oh, yeah.
A: Put on a coat and tie.
B: Why?
A: To show respect to God and others.
B: I'm glad Sunday is only once a week.
A: I hope God didn't hear that.
B: He'll forgive me



A: Did you feed the cat?
B: I'll do that in a minute.
A: The cat is meowing. He's hungry.
B: Okay. I'll feed him right now.
A: You shouldn't make him wait.
B: I was doing my homework.
A: The cat doesn't care about your homework.
B: The cat doesn't care about anything.
A: That's the way cats are.
B: All they think about is themselves.
A: Maybe we should get rid of him.
B: Of course not! He's family.



A: I hate shaving.
B: Me too.
A: I just cut myself again.
B: Did you use a new blade?
A: It doesn't matter. Old blades cut, new blades cut.
B: Maybe you should use an electric shaver.
A: They make a lot of noise, but they don't give a close shave.
B: Maybe you should stop shaving.
A: And grow a beard?
B: Sure. Why not?
A: Because food and other stuff sticks in my beard.
B: Hmm. Here's an idea. Put cream on your face and have the cat lick it off.



A: Excuse me.
B: Yes?
A: Are you reading this paper?
B: Oh, no. Help yourself.
A: I asked because the paper is sitting next to you.
B: Thank you. That's polite of you to ask.
A: Some people would just pick it up.
B: Yes, I know. Some people are rude.
A: I always try to be polite.
B: So do I.
A: The world needs more polite people like us.
B: I agree 100 percent.



A: Mom, I want a puppy.
B: Let me think about it.
A: Why do you have to think about it?
B: Because a puppy costs money.
A: No, it doesn't. Puppies are free.
B: Yes, but a puppy needs shots.
A: Shots for what?
B: So it won't get sick. Just like you get shots.
A: I hate shots.
B: And a puppy eats food. Food costs money.
A: No problem. I'll give him food off my plate.
B: Oh, no you don't. Puppies don't eat vegetables.



A: Look at all these kittens!
B: How many are there?
A: Eight.
B: They're all so cute.
A: Yes, but I can't keep them.
B: What are you going to do with them?
A: I'm going to give them away. Do you want one?
B: Yes, I would love one.
A: Which one do you want?
B: That one. The one that's all black.
A: Yes, I like that one, too.
B: I'll call him Blacky.



A: My parents go to church every Sunday.
B: They trust in God.
A: They hope they will go to heaven.
B: They probably will.
A: But no one knows for sure.
B: That's for sure.
A: No one knows what happens after we die.
B: If we are good, we will be happy in heaven with God.
A: That's what many people believe.
B: If we are bad, we will be unhappy forever in hell.
A: I don't want to go to hell.
B: Let's go to church with your parents on Sunday.



A: My husband died.
B: I'm sorry for you.
A: Thank you.
B: When did he die?
A: A couple of months ago.
B: You still miss him.
A: Yes, but I talk to him almost every day.
B: When you go to church?
A: No, when I call him on his cell phone.
B: What do you mean?
A: I buried him with his cell phone.
B: What will you do when the battery dies?



A: Today is Friday the thirteenth.
B: That's a bad day.
A: It's supposed to be unlucky.
B: You're supposed to stay home all day.
A: That's what I do.
B: My friend stayed in a hotel on Friday the thirteenth.
A: That was a mistake.
B: He stayed on the thirteenth floor.
A: What happened?
B: Someone stole his laptop.
A: He was asking for it.
B: He learned his lesson. He's home today.



A: You have pretty eyes.
B: Thank you. So do you.
A: I wish my eyes were blue.
B: What's the matter with green eyes?
A: Nothing, except my favorite color is blue.
B: Maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes.
A: But what if I'm a fish in my next life?
B: I think some fish have blue eyes.
A: I hope I don't come back as a fish.
B: I hope I come back as a cat.
A: Cats have beautiful eyes.
B: I would love to have blue cat-eyes.



A: Do you have a girlfriend?
B: No, I don't. Do you?
A: I don't have a girlfriend, either.
B: Why not?
A: I don't know. Maybe I'm not rich enough.
B: Girls like guys with money.
A: They sure do.
B: They like guys with new cars.
A: I don't have money or a new car.
B: Me, neither.
A: But girls like guys who are funny.
B: Maybe we should learn some good jokes.



A: We had a problem at school.
B: What was the problem?
A: Someone cut the tires.
B: What tires?
A: The tires on the cars.
B: Where were the cars?
A: They were in the student parking lot.
B: How many tires were cut?
A: One or two tires were cut on each car.
B: How many cars?
A: Eleven cars.
B: That's terrible. I hope they catch the person.



A: Gravity is very important.
B: What is gravity?
A: It's the force that pulls everything down.
B: I don't understand.
A: If you pour water into a glass, the water goes down into the glass.
B: Of course it does.
A: Without gravity, the water would go up.
B: You're joking.
A: Without gravity, you would go up.
B: What do you mean?
A: You would float into the sky like a balloon.
B: That would be fun!



A: I'm a good card player.
B: Why is that?
A: Because I watch the other players.
B: What do you mean?
A: People will tell you if they have a good hand.
B: How do they do that?
A: For example, a friend of mine licks his lips.
B: When he licks his lips, you know he has a good hand?
A: I know he has a good hand, so I don't bet.
B: He never wins your money?
A: Nope, and it drives him crazy.
B: He knows you can't read his mind. Maybe he thinks you're cheating.



A: Do you really love me?
B: Of course.
A: Prove it.
B: How can I prove it?
A: Take me to dinner.
B: That's it? That's all I have to do?
A: Take me to a nice restaurant, not to McDonald's.
B: But a nice restaurant costs money.
A: Yes, and you have to make a reservation.
B: That's such a hassle.
A: I knew you didn't love me.
B: Okay, okay! I'll make a reservation right now.



A: My parents are divorced.
B: So are mine.
A: Why did your parents get divorced?
B: My father found a new girlfriend.
A: That's too bad.
B: My mother was hurt and angry.
A: She had good reason. What did she do?
B: She told him to drop his girlfriend.
A: What did your father do?
B: He moved out of our house.
A: I guess he really liked his new girlfriend.
B: Yes, but she left him a year later.



A: My grandma's apartment smells funny.
B: So does mine.
A: I think it's an old people's smell.
B: Really?
A: Yes. I think when you get old, you begin to smell.
B: Like fruit that is too ripe?
A: Yes, just like fruit that is too ripe.
B: But the smell is different.
A: Yes, old people don't smell like fruit.
B: No, they smell like a thrift shop.
A: Yes, a thrift shop has that same smell.
B: Yes, an old smell.



A: The price of stamps goes up and up.
B: I think stamps used to cost a penny.
A: That was a long time ago.
B: It was before I was born.
A: Now a stamp is 42 cents.
B: But in May it will be 44 cents.
A: Have you ever lost a letter in the mail?
B: No, I haven't.
A: Neither have I.
B: So, they do a good job for the money.
A: Yes, they do.
B: Maybe we shouldn't complain.



A: A button came off my shirt.
B: What are you going to do?
A: First, I have to find the button.
B: Where did you lose it?
A: I have no idea.
B: A button is hard to find. Did you look in your pant cuffs?
A: That's a good idea.
B: I found a button in my pant cuffs one time.
A: Let me look. No, it's not there.
B: Many shirts come with an extra button.
A: You're right. This one does have an extra button.
B: Now all you have to do is sew it on.



A: I have to go to the bathroom.
B: You drink too much coffee.
A: But I love coffee.
B: Well, it's your life.
A: You eat too much chocolate.
B: I don't think so.
A: Have you looked in the mirror?
B: Do you think I'm getting fat?
A: I didn't say that.
B: What did you say?
A: I said I have to go to the bathroom.
B: That's what I thought you said.



A: Did you do the laundry?
B: Yes, I did.
A: What did you wash?
B: I washed the sheets and towels.
A: What about the pillowcases?
B: Yes, I took them off the pillows and washed them.
A: Did you dry everything in the dryer?
B: Yes, I dried everything in the dryer.
A: Then what did you do?
B: I folded all the towels.
A: Did you put the sheets on the beds?
B: Yes, and I put the pillowcases on the pillows.



A: Do you listen to the radio?
B: I listen day and night.
A: What do you listen to?
B: Mostly talk radio.
A: What's that?
B: People talk about current events.
A: What do they say?
B: They say they want change.
A: What kind of change?
B: They want tax cuts.
A: Why do they want tax cuts?
B: Because tax cuts will save them money.



A: Mom, I'm hungry.
B: Look in the fridge.
A: I'm looking. There's nothing to eat.
B: Are you sure?
A: It's almost empty.
B: I went to the market yesterday.
A: I don't see anything.
B: I bought lots of oranges and apples.
A: I don't want fruit. I want something tasty.
B: Eat the fruit. It's good for you.
A: Next time you go to the market, let me go with you.
B: No, thank you. All you want to eat are hot dogs and candy bars.



A: What is there to eat?
B: I don't know. Look in the fridge.
A: I think I'll make a sandwich.
B: What kind?
A: A ham sandwich.
B: The bread is in the cabinet.
A: Where's the mustard?
B: It's in the fridge, I think.
A: Oh, yes, here it is. Do you want a sandwich?
B: Yes, that sounds nice.
A: How about some potato chips?
B: Yes. And a pickle, if we have any.



A: I can't read my book.
B: Turn on the light.
A: The light is on.
B: Open the book.
A: The book is open.
B: See an eye doctor.
A: That's what I need to do.
B: He'll give you a prescription for glasses.
A: I'll make an appointment tomorrow.
B: I'll get the yellow pages for an eye doctor.
A: Read the phone number to me.
B: I'll read it very loud, in case your hearing is getting bad, too.



A: Life isn't fair.
B: It sure isn't.
A: I got a ticket yesterday.
B: What for?
A: I was crossing the street.
B: Were you in a crosswalk?
A: Yes, but the red hand was blinking.
B: So? That's a ticket?
A: Yes, it's a $140 ticket.
B: That's not right!
A: When I started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking.
B: You need to walk faster.



A: Turn the radio down, please.
B: But I'm listening to it.
A: Well, listen to it more quietly.
B: I can't wait till I grow up.
A: What will you do?
B: I will play the radio as loud as I want.
A: That's okay with me.
B: I will have a radio in every room of my house.
A: Remind me to never visit you.
B: All the radios will be on extra loud.
A: Your neighbors will hate you.
B: If they don't like it, they can move.



A: I love you.
B: I love you, too.
A: I loved you the first day I saw you.
B: It was love at first sight?
A: Yes, it was love at first sight.
B: I didn't love you at first.
A: I know. I had to chase you for a while.
B: Yes, you chased me and then you caught me.
A: Now you're mine forever.
B: And you're mine forever.
A: We'll grow old together.
B: And be happy together.



A: Where are you going?
B: I have to walk the dog.
A: What kind of dog do you have?
B: I have a little poodle.
A: Poodles bark a lot.
B: They sure do.
A: They bark at everything.
B: They never shut up.
A: Why did you get a poodle?
B: It's my mom's dog.
A: So she likes poodles.
B: She says they're good watchdogs.



A: It's time for your bath, young lady.
B: But, Mom, I'm not dirty.
A: You need a bath every day.
B: Why?
A: Because you don't want to smell bad.
B: I don't smell bad.
A: That's what you think.
B: If I smelled bad, I could smell me.
A: I can smell you.
B: I can smell you, too.
A: That's my perfume.
B: When can I wear perfume?



A: Something's wrong with my computer.
B: Exactly what?
A: All I get is a black screen.
B: What's the matter?
A: I think I know, because this happened before.
B: What happened before?
A: My hard drive crashed.
B: Oh, no. That's bad news.
A: It sure is, but I'm going to call HP first, just to make sure.
B: Will you lose all your files?
A: No, I always back up my files.
B: You're smart.



A: I called HP about my computer.
B: What did they say?
A: They said I need a new hard drive.
B: That's too bad. How much is a new one?
A: It's not too much, only about $85.
B: Plus installation?
A: No, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace.
B: Really?
A: Yes, it's just a couple of screws.
B: That's nice.
A: It's a lot better than paying someone $60.
B: If my hard drive crashes, I'll just call you.



A: What's your email address?
B: It's bluedog123.
A: Bluedog123. Are you sure that's all?
B: Yes.
A: No. That's incomplete.
B: What do you mean?
A: What's your mailing address?
B: 456 Cherry Drive, Pasadena, CA 91170.
A: That's correct.
B: So what's the problem?
A: Bluedog123 is just the street. You have to give me the city, state, and ZIP 
code.
B: Oh, I get it. My email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com.



A: I'm going to take a nap.
B: You should unplug the phone.
A: That's a good idea.
B: Do you want me to wake you in an hour?
A: No, thanks. Just let me sleep until I wake up.
B: I'll start dinner at 6:00.
A: Okay. I think I'll be awake by then.
B: If not, your nose will wake you up.
A: You mean I will smell the food cooking?
B: You might even dream about dinner.
A: I don't think I'm going to dream about anything. I'm really tired.
B: Have a nice nap.



A: That was a nice funeral.
B: Yes, dad, it was.
A: The son gave a nice speech about his father.
B: It was long, too.
A: I think it was about 45 minutes long.
B: But it went by fast. It was interesting.
A: I liked it.
B: I'll give you a speech like that, too.
A: Do you think anyone will come to my funeral?
B: Of course.
A: I think only the family will be there.
B: You have lots of friends. They will be there, too!



A: Yikes! What was that noise?
B: I had to blow my nose.
A: Did you have to blow right next to the phone?
B: Did you hear that?
A: Of course I heard that. I thought a plane had crashed into your house.
B: It wasn't that loud.
A: I will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see.
B: Okay. I'll take your word for it.
A: I thought you had an elephant in your house.
B: You're funny.
A: What did you say? I think I've gone deaf.
B: I'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose. I'll be right back.



A: I have lots of friends.
B: Really? How many do you have?
A: I don't know, maybe one hundred.
B: That is a lot of friends. Do you have a best friend?
A: Of course. I have lots of best friends.
B: How many best friends do you have?
A: I think about twenty-five.
B: Hmm. I have only one best friend.
A: I feel sorry for you.
B: I have only a few friends.
A: You must be lonely. I will share my friends with you.
B: That's very nice of you.



A: Don't you ever cheat on me.
B: Why would I do that?
A: Because men like to cheat.
B: Some men do, but not me.
A: I'm watching you.
B: I'm an open book. Watch me all you want.
A: If I catch you, you'll be sorry.
B: You won't catch me, because I love you. I'm not a cheater.
A: I will poke your eyes out. 
B: I don't want any other woman.
A: I will chop your toes off, one by one.
B: Honey, please. You're the only woman for me, forever. I swear it.



A: I hate to go outside.
B: Me too.
A: Why do you hate to go outside?
B: I meet too many jerks.
A: I agree.
B: This city is full of jerks.
A: Rude people are everywhere.
B: But what can you do?
A: You can yell at them.
B: And they will yell back at you.
A: Yelling doesn't do any good.
B: No. The best thing to do is just stay home.



A: I'm in love with that girl.
B: Have you told her?
A: Of course not.
B: Why not?
A: She would laugh at me.
B: How do you know?
A: Because they always do.
B: Maybe she's different.
A: They're all the same.
B: Just ask her out to dinner.
A: And then what?
B: And then she'll know that you like her.



A: Can I borrow $5?
B: Sure. Why do you need it?
A: I want to buy lunch.
B: Where's your money?
A: It's not in my wallet.
B: Your wallet is empty?
A: I don't have even one dollar in it.
B: Being broke is no fun.
A: Even if it's only for a short while.
B: It's always good to have friends.
A: Friends will lend you money when you're broke.
B: As long as you pay them back.



A: I hope I win the lotto.
B: Your chances are very small.
A: But you can't win if you don't play.
B: Ha! You can't win if you do play.
A: Someone has to win.
B: That's what everyone says.
A: It might as well be me.
B: That's what everyone says.
A: You're trying to tell me something.
B: That didn't take long.
A: You think I should quit playing.
B: Save your money for school.



A: You're driving too fast.
B: Why do you say that?
A: The speed limit is 65.
B: I know that.
A: But you're doing 75.
B: So is everyone else.
A: But a cop might stop you.
B: No, he won't. Some cars are doing 85.
A: So the cop will stop those cars?
B: Of course. He stops the fastest cars.
A: My friend got a ticket for doing 75.
B: Your friend was unlucky.



A: What do you need for school?
B: I need pencils.
A: Anything else?
B: I need a notebook.
A: Do you need a pen?
B: No. I already have a pen.
A: Do you need a calculator?
B: No. The teacher doesn't permit calculators.
A: How about a dictionary?
B: No, we have a big dictionary in the classroom.
A: Well, I guess that's it.
B: Yes, that's all I need for now.



A: Will you look at this form?
B: Are you having problems with it?
A: I don't understand some things.
B: Let me help you.
A: What does "MI" mean?
B: "MI" stands for Middle Initial.
A: What does "MM/DD/YY" mean?
B: That means Month/Day/Year. Use numbers.
A: I don't understand.
B: For example, if your birth date is January 12, 1987, write 01/12/87.
A: Oh. That's simple enough.
B: Always print clearly, and fill in the bubbles completely.



A: Let's go to the animal shelter.
B: What do you want to do?
A: I want to get a puppy for my son.
B: That will make him so happy.
A: I'll get him one of those little dogs.
B: One that won't grow up too big.
A: And eat too much.
B: Do you know which one he would like?
A: Oh, yes, I took him there yesterday. He showed me one that he really liked.
B: I bet you had to drag him away.
A: He wanted to take it home yesterday.
B: I wonder what he'll name it.



A: What's the weather like?
B: I don't know. I just woke up.
A: Why don't you look outside?
B: Okay. It looks like rain.
A: Why do you say that?
B: The sky is gray.
A: Is it raining right now?
B: No.
A: How do you know?
B: The street isn't wet.
A: I have to go shopping today.
B: You'd better take an umbrella.



A: I can't believe how hot it is.
B: It's not even noon yet.
A: That means it will get hotter.
B: I am dying from the heat.
A: Turn on the air conditioner.
B: It doesn't work.
A: What happened?
B: I don't know.
A: Did you call the repairman?
B: Of course.
A: When is he coming?
B: He's busy. He said next week.



A: I'll be glad when winter comes.
B: Why is that?
A: Because I love the snow.
B: Yes, the snow is fun.
A: Last year we made a big snowman.
B: How big was it?
A: It was seven feet tall.
B: How long did it take?
A: It took us all day.
B: Did you give him a nose?
A: Of course. We gave him a big carrot for a nose.
B: Let me help you make one this year.



A: I'm going to the bank.
B: What do you need to do?
A: I need to withdraw some money.
B: How are you going to do that?
A: I'll just use the ATM.
B: What's that?
A: It's the Automatic Teller Machine.
B: It gives you money?
A: I just insert my debit card into the machine.
B: And it gives you money?
A: Well, it gives me money, but it's my own money.
B: Oh. What good is that? I thought it gave you free money.



A: Did you put the blue bin out on the street?
B: Oh, no. I forgot.
A: Well, you'd better take it out front.
B: What time does the recycle truck come by?
A: It usually gets here at noon on Tuesday, which is tomorrow.
B: I'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning.
A: Oh, no, you don't.
B: What do you mean?
A: Every morning you get up late and rush off to work late.
B: Do you think I'll forget to do it?
A: You'll remember to do it, but you won't have time to do it.
B: Okay, I'll take it out front right now.



A: Are you ready?
B: Ready for what?
A: Ready for the big switch.
B: What are you talking about?
A: The nation is switching to digital TV.
B: Oh. Of course I'm ready.
A: Did you buy the converter?
B: No, I don't need a converter because I bought a digital TV.
A: How much was that?
B: It was only about $120 for a 13-inch screen.
A: Does it pick up any digital channels?
B: Oh, yes. I get six Korean channels but nothing in English!



A: People are funny.
B: They sure are.
A: Did you hear about the pilot?
B: The one that stole a small plane?
A: Yes, he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U.S.
B: Did they catch him?
A: Yes. After two U.S. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway.
B: Did he crash?
A: No, he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant.
B: Did the cops find out why he flew into the U.S.?
A: His life sucked. He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.
B: Poor guy.



A: The police need our help finding a robber.
B: How do you know?
A: The TV news is reporting a bank robbery.
B: Do they know what the robber looks like?
A: Yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old.
B: What race is he?
A: They didn't say.
B: The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore.
A: Of course not. That would be racist.
B: But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?
A: Don't ask me.
B: Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist.



A: I like this magazine.
B: So do I.
A: I read it once, and I subscribed.
B: It gives you all the news.
A: All the news in only 50 pages.
B: I like the political cartoons.
A: I like the beautiful photos of the houses for sale.
B: I always read the film reviews.
A: I never miss the food and drink section.
B: I gave a subscription to my parents.
A: Me too. They canceled their other news magazines.
B: So did mine!



A: Give me a hug.
B: I'm not in the mood.
A: What's the matter?
B: I saw you looking at that woman.
A: What woman?
B: You know, that woman with the big boobs.
A: I was not looking at her.
B: You were, too.
A: I'm not interested in her.
B: Then why were you looking at her?
A: I was looking at something else.
B: Oh, really? Then spend tonight looking at the sofa.



A: Remember to put air in your tires.
B: How often do I have to do that?
A: Once every two months.
B: That's a lot.
A: What do you mean?
B: That's six times a year!
A: Yes, and it takes about five minutes each time.
B: I'll try.
A: Check your tires or you'll get a flat.
B: Oh. That's not good.
A: No, it isn't. A flat costs you time and money.
B: And I don't have either.



A: Let's go to the beach.
B: That's a great idea.
A: We haven't been in a while.
B: We haven't been in a month.
A: The last time we went, you almost drowned.
B: No, I didn't.
A: Then why did the lifeguard dive into the water?
B: I think he wanted to cool off.
A: He swam right up to you.
B: And then he turned right around.
A: Maybe you're right.
B: Maybe we should get going.



A: What's on TV?
B: Nothing much.
A: What about the baseball game?
B: It got rained out.
A: Rained out?
B: Yes, rained out.
A: How could that be?
B: Well, you can't play baseball in a rainstorm.
A: I thought they were playing under a dome.
B: The dome doesn't close.
A: Why doesn't it close?
B: Who knows? They said they'll fix it before next season.



A: Don't wipe your nose on your sleeve.
B: But I don't have a tissue.
A: Then go find a tissue in the bathroom.
B: I didn't have time to get one from there.
A: Your sleeves are not tissues.
B: But Mom, all my friends use their sleeves.
A: That doesn't make it right.
B: I saw Dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.
A: I will talk to your father about that.
B: I bet Dad did it all the time when he was my age.
A: Your daddy was a good little boy.
B: How do you know? Were you his mommy, too?



A: I'm worried.
B: Worried about what?
A: I'm getting married.
B: You should be happy, not worried.
A: I am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.
B: Yes, you have to take care of your wife.
A: And I have to take care of our children.
B: Are you going to start a family?
A: Yes. We want to have a little boy and a little girl.
B: That sounds wonderful.
A: Except we can't afford it!
B: No wonder you're worried.



A: I don't get art.
B: Or artists.
A: They're in a different world.
B: I saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.
A: The artist said the jar was both full and empty.
B: But it was full of pencils! How could he say it was empty?
A: Artists see things differently.
B: Did you ever see anything that Picasso painted?
A: Of course! He's world famous.
B: Did he ever take art lessons?
A: I can't believe it. I drew paintings like that in third grade.
B: Where are they? Maybe they are worth millions.



A: What's the point?
B: The point of what?
A: Of living.
B: Who knows? You live, and then you die.
A: We must be here for some reason.
B: Maybe we're here to have fun.
A: Then why aren't I having fun?
B: Because you're thinking too much.
A: So I should stop thinking?
B: Stop thinking about what the point is.
A: Okay. I'll start thinking about having some fun.
B: Just be patient. Fun doesn't come along every five minutes.



A: Beer is a powerful drug.
B: So are cigarettes.
A: Which would you prefer?
B: What do you mean?
A: When you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes.
B: I could pick only one or the other?
A: Yes. Nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.
B: Boy, that's a tough one.
A: What's so tough about it? Of course, I would pick cigarettes.
B: But cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.
A: Well, you can't have everything.
B: I don't think I want to go to your heaven.



A: My pants have a hole in the front pocket.
B: You shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.
A: Yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.
B: Lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.
A: Who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?
B: Criminals, of course.
A: Anyway, I have to fix the hole.
B: You can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.
A: Tell me about this patch.
B: The patch has glue. The hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
A: That sounds a lot easier than sewing.
B: It is. But after about ten washings, the glue washes off.



A: Do you know any good jokes?
B: I can't remember jokes.
A: Neither can I.
B: They go in one ear and out the other.
A: Who makes up all these jokes?
B: Who knows? But there must be a hundred new ones every day.
A: Yes, just in English alone.
B: I wonder if every language has jokes.
A: Of course! People everywhere like good jokes.
B: What do you think people joke about the most?
A: I think most jokes are about women.
B: Oh, really? I think most jokes are about men!



A: You're very lucky.
B: Why do you say that?
A: You speak two languages.
B: Well, my English isn't perfect.
A: No one speaks perfect English.
B: Maybe I will be the first!
A: I've been thinking about learning Spanish.
B: Spanish is easy. I'll be happy to teach you.
A: How long will it take me to learn?
B: I think it will only take you a year or two.
A: How soon can we begin?
B: Ahora! That means right now.



A: Do you know what today is?
B: Yes, it's April 22.
A: It's more than just a date.
B: Is it your birthday or anniversary?
A: No, it's Earth Day.
B: What's that?
A: It's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.
B: Oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?
A: Yes. We need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags.
B: How about if I take shorter showers?
A: That's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water.
B: From now on I'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower.



A: Poetry sucks.
B: I don't know anyone who likes it.
A: Some of it is okay, I guess.
B: Yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.
A: Like "One, two, buckle my shoe."
B: But people still write poems.
A: No one makes any money at it.
B: Shakespeare was a poet.
A: Did he get rich from his poetry?
B: Probably not.
A: Poems are a little bit like songs.
B: Yes, but songs have music. Without music, songs would suck, too.



A: Can I try your coffee?
B: Sure. Here you go.
A: Hmm, that's not bad.
B: There's nothing in it.
A: What do you mean?
B: I mean, it's just coffee.
A: I figured that.
B: It's not too bitter for you?
A: It's a little bitter, but it's okay.
B: There's no sugar or cream in it.
A: No, it's a taste you have to get used to.
B: Sort of like beer.



A: You're driving too fast.
B: I'm in a hurry.
A: Don't ever be in a hurry.
B: It's not my fault. You didn't wake me up.
A: That's not my fault. You didn't tell me to wake you up.
B: Well, I meant to.
A: Don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving.
B: Why not?
A: Because you'll have an accident. Most accidents are because people are in a hurry.
B: How do you know that?
A: I read a lot.
B: I thought drunks caused most accidents.



A: Would you like to go on a blind date?
B: You must be joking.
A: No, I'm serious.
B: I don't want to date a blind woman.
A: A blind date doesn't mean that she is blind!
B: What does it mean?
A: A blind date is a date with someone you don't know.
B: Why would I date someone I don't even know?
A: To try something new and exciting.
B: What if I don't like her?
A: Then you don't date her again.



A: Are you married?
B: No. I'm divorced.
A: When did you get divorced?
B: I got divorced two years ago.
A: Why did you get divorced?
B: My wife left me.
A: Why did she leave you?
B: She said she didn't love me anymore.
A: Wow! That's terrible.
B: Yes, it was.
A: Why didn't she love you anymore?
B: She fell in love with my best friend.



A: My pen is out of ink.
B: Shake it a couple of times.
A: I shook it. There is no more ink.
B: You can borrow mine.
A: Thank you. I'll buy a new one tomorrow.
B: What were you doing?
A: I was writing a letter.
B: Who were you writing to?
A: It's to my mom.
B: Tell her I said hello.
A: Okay. I'll return your pen when I'm done.
B: Take your time.



A: How smart are you?
B: I don't know. I think I'm average.
A: Did you ever take an IQ test?
B: No, I never did. All I know is that I got A's and B's in school.
A: I wish I was really smart.
B: Don't be ridiculous.
A: What do you mean?
B: If you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.
A: Don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?
B: It must be very lonely.
A: Why's that?
B: Because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying.



A: I missed the TV news last night. What was on?
B: Nothing that would pass as news.
A: What's the weather going to be like this weekend?
B: I don't know. Whenever the weather comes on, I switch channels.
A: What was the lead story on the news?
B: Some actress was in court for driving without a license.
A: What was the second story?
B: Some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter.
A: What was the third story?
B: A bull chased a man in a supermarket.
A: Wasn't there anything about Octo-Mom?
B: Of course. She's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants.



A: What are you going to do about your death?
B: Well, mostly I'll try to avoid it.
A: I mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?
B: My wife and I will be cremated.
A: Are you going to be buried next to each other?
B: Oh, no. Our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.
A: You're not going to be buried?
B: A coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.
A: Yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.
B: Children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.
A: That's true. A cemetery is for dead people, not living people.
B: We figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach.



A: What are you getting for your mom?
B: What are you talking about?
A: Sunday is Mother's Day.
B: This Sunday?
A: Of course. It's all over the news.
B: I thought it was next Sunday.
A: Well, you'd better get her something.
B: I'll get her a nice card.
A: Is that it?
B: Yes. That's all I ever give her.
A: She raised you, and all you ever give her is a card?
B: It's okay. She knows that I love her.



A: I don't like our flag.
B: What's the matter with it?
A: It's too much like other flags.
B: Yes, a lot of flags have stripes.
A: A flag should be pretty.
B: What should our flag look like?
A: It should have a pretty woman on it.
B: That's ridiculous!
A: You don't like pretty women?
B: Of course I do. But not on our flag!
A: Every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
B: You can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it!



A: I had a busy morning.
B: What did you do?
A: I watered all the plants.
B: You have a lot of plants.
A: Then I did my laundry.
B: That takes some time.
A: I took the dog for a walk.
B: I'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
A: I vacuumed the entire house.
B: That's a lot of work.
A: And then I made lunch.
B: I'll bet you were hungry!



A: I don't have long distance service with my home phone.
B: So how do you make long distance calls?
A: I use a calling card.
B: Where do you get that?
A: I buy it at the dollar store.
B: How much is it?
A: It's one dollar for 100 minutes.
B: That's only a penny a minute!
A: It's a great price. But you have to dial a lot of numbers.
B: How many?
A: First you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers.
B: Yikes. I think I'll keep my long distance service.



A: Let's take a walk.
B: What's the weather like?
A: Let me step outside and see.
B: It's a little chilly, right?
A: Yes, it is.
B: I'll put on my cap.
A: Wear a jacket, too.
B: I wonder if I should bring my gloves.
A: Maybe you should, just in case it gets colder.
B: I'll put a glove in each pocket.
A: We'll get warmer as we walk.
B: Yes, but it gets colder as the sun goes down.



A: Let's go for a ride.
B: Where are we going?
A: Into the mountains.
B: That sounds nice.
A: I want to show you my new car.
B: You bought a new car?
A: Yes. I bought a Cadillac.
B: A luxury car.
A: Luxury plus speed.
B: What are we waiting for?
A: Let me get the keys.
B: Let me get my camera.



A: Have you done your homework?
B: Not yet.
A: Then why are you watching TV?
B: This is my favorite show.
A: Go do your homework.
B: But, mom!
A: You can watch TV after you do your homework.
B: But the show will be over.
A: There will be another show next week.
B: Please?
A: You know the rules.
B: I hate the rules! I can't wait till I grow up.



A: I have a date tomorrow night.
B: Really? Who with?
A: A girl I met at the market.
B: You met a girl at the supermarket?
A: She was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.
B: What did you say to her?
A: I had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where I had found them.
B: She asked you about your pineapples?
A: I told her I had gotten the last two on the shelf, but I offered her one of mine.
B: That was nice of you.
A: She asked me how she could return the favor, so I asked her out.
B: Sometimes a slow line can be a good thing.



A: I'm bored.
B: What's on TV?
A: Nothing.
B: There must be something on TV!
A: Nothing that's interesting.
B: What about that new game show?
A: Which one?
B: "Deal or No Deal"
A: Tell me you're joking.
B: I love that show.
A: I watched it once. That was enough.
B: It's on right now. Let's watch it together.



A: Look at the car chase on TV!
B: That driver is crazy.
A: I can't believe he hasn't crashed.
B: How fast is he going?
A: They say he's going 80 miles per hour.
B: He's going to kill someone.
A: Look! He just hit that car.
B: Oh, my goodness. No one is safe on the streets.
A: Now he's slowing down.
B: Maybe he ran out of gas.
A: Look! He just got out of the car and started running.
B: I hope the police catch him.



A: I like living here.
B: I agree. Pasadena is a nice city.
A: It's not too big.
B: And it's not too small.
A: It has great weather all year long.
B: It has the Rose Parade.
A: It has beautiful houses.
B: It has wonderful restaurants.
A: It has great schools.
B: It's close to the mountains.
A: The people are friendly.
B: I'm not ever going to leave.



A: I have to go to the bathroom.
B: Why didn't you go before we left?
A: I did, but I have to go again.
B: Well, hold on a little longer.
A: I think I'm going to explode.
B: Just hold on.
A: Oh! Don't hit any more bumps!
B: We'll be at McDonald's in just a few minutes.
A: I hope they are fast minutes.
B: Think about something else. Think about a hamburger.
A: I'm thinking, but I still have to go.
B: It's the next exit. Hold on!



A: Did you have a date Friday night?
B: Yes, in fact, I did.
A: Who did you go out with?
B: A man I met in a coffee shop.
A: Where did you go?
B: We went to a nice restaurant.
A: Anywhere else?
B: Then we went to a jazz club.
A: That sounds like a nice date.
B: Yes, it was pleasant.
A: But you won't date him again?
B: No. He was nice, but there was no chemistry.



A: I can't wait until I graduate.
B: Me too.
A: No more homework.
B: I hate homework.
A: Are you going to college?
B: I can't afford it.
A: Me neither.
B: So what are you going to do?
A: I'm joining the army.
B: You're kidding. You might get killed.
A: I don't think so. After I finish, I'll have enough money to go to college.
B: That's not a bad idea.
