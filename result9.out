Episode 81: Hello stranger! 



Khalid:
Hello, stranger!	




Helen:
Ooh, hi Khalid! How are you? It's been ages, hasn't it?



Khalid:
I know! I haven't seen you since the barbecue. 




Helen:
Oh yeah, the barbecue. It was a smashing day wasn't it? But poor Alice was really ill the next day. 



Khalid:
 Was she?



Helen:
She had to go to the doctors. But she's as right as rain now. Anyway Khalid, what's happening with you?



Khalid:
Well, I've just enrolled on a part-time course here at the university, and I'm still a student at the language school!



Helen:
Wow! So you're studying hard?



Khalid:
Of course! But it's not easily to study at home. My flatmates are really rowdy and I can never get any peace and quiet. 


Helen:
Hmm... I might be able to help you with that.
Episode 82: A tour of the flat



Helen:
So that's Tim's room, the bathroom's over there, and your bedroom is here. It's got a desk and chair and all that, so you shouldn't need any more furniture.




Khalid:
Ok, that looks ok. erm, what do you guys do about housework?



Alice:
Everybody kind of chips in, don't they Tim?




Tim:
Yes, Alice, we all do our bit.



Alice:
We keep all the cleaning stuff in this cupboard here.



Khalid:
Ok, I see.



Helen:
So, what do you think?



Khalid:
It's a very nice room, and you guys are great and everything, but I have to say, I think it's a little bit pricey. I wonder if it would be possible to reduce the rent a little bit?



Helen:
Well, I'm afraid it isn't up to me Khalid, I'll have to ask my dad about that.
Episode 86: Another date



Paul:

I'm pleased everything's out in the open now Alice.  I didn't like hiding things from you.    



Alice:

You should have told me right from the word go, Paul. It was the way I found out that made me so upset.



Paul:

I know Alice, and I'm sorry. But things are going to be very different from now on. I've got a good feeling about you and me, do you know that?



Alice:

I'm glad.



Paul:

Oh my goodness, is that the time? 



Alice:

What's the matter?



Paul:

Oh gosh, Alice, I've got to fly, I'm picking Ellie up from school and I'm think I'm going to be late!	



Alice:

Aren't you going to finish your coffee?



Paul:

There's no time, I'm late as it is, bye!



Alice:

Bye. Paul.
Episode 88: The boss's plan 


Boss:

 Would you like to hear it? You'll like it, I promise!
				 


Tim:

I'm listening... 


Boss:

 Look Tim, my little plan could get us both out of quite a tight spot. It's quite simple really, you just say that you noticed the watch boxes had been tampered with when you accepted the delivery from the suppliers. That'll take the heat off us and move the investigation onto them. 


Tim:

 Yeah, but the police won't just take my word for it, will they? 


Boss:

 That's true Tim, they probably won't, but I'm going to arrange for them to find some more evidence to link the fake watches firmly to the supplier and not us. I won't go into details, but it'll work, trust me.  


Tim:

 So somebody else will end up being charged with a crime they didn't commit.  


Boss:

 Well if it isn't somebody else Tim, it'll probably be you. 


Tim:

 Can I just say something here?


Boss:

 Yes Tim, what is it?
Episode 89: Tim fights back 


Tim:

               I won't do it! You swapped the real watches for the fake ones and now you're trying to wriggle out of it.


Boss:

                Tim, you're making some very serious allegations. Do you actually have any hard evidence?


Tim:

                Well, I bet the police do. I bet it's only a matter of time before you're behind bars, where you should be.


Boss:

                I don't think so. You're the one who sold the watches and if anyone's going to prison, it's you, Tim. But whatever happens, I think our working relationship is about to come to an end, don't you?


Tim:

                You mean you're firing me?


Boss:

                I'm sorry Tim, I think I'm going to have to let you go.


Tim:

               Oh no, you can't fire me, because you know what? I quit!!!
Episode 92: The cost of living


Tim:

So how are you settling in then Khalid?



Khalid:

                There is going well Tim. You've all been really friendly, footy in the park 		and cups of teas in the afternoon. I can't believe I get all this for only £75 a week. 


Tim:

                How much? 


Khalid:

              £75. I know it's less than what you're paying but us students need every discount we can get. 
			  


Tim:

              Oh yeah, I, I knew you'd got a discount, I just didn't realise how much of one you'd wangled. 



Khalid:

             Did I put my foot in it? 


Tim:

           No, no Khalid but there's, there's an old saying "If you don't ask, you don't get" so maybe it's time for this jobless one to start negotiating a bit too.
Episode 1:
At the airport


Helen:
What does Michal look like?


Tim:
Well, he's tall and well built. He's 
                            got brown eyes and a shaved head.


Helen:
Is he handsome?


Tim:
 Of course he is! He's my cousin.


Helen:
And what's he like? Is he like you 
                            too?


Tim:
 No, he's quite shy really.


Helen:
Oh look! Is that him?


Tim:
Yeah! Michal! Michal! He's crying. I 
                            wonder what's wrong.
Episode 10: Choosing a film


Alice:
Oh, what do you  fancy seeing? There's Must Love Dogs - a rom-com. Oh I love romantic comedies, don't you? Pride and Prejudice is on - I adore period 	dramas. You know all those fine ladies and gents from ages  ago, long dresses and grand houses. What kind of films do you like - action, 	adventure, musicals? 


Michal:Films about people living in the future, on other planets.


Alice: Oh, sci-fi - not really my thing. 


Michal: Well, what about Nightmare on Elm Street? They're showing that again here.


Alice: No thanks, horror films don't do it for me. 


Michal: Well, why don't you choose?

Alice:
No, you invited me out, you choose.

Michal:
No, I insist.
Episode 100: More tears


Helen:
Alice! Please don't cry. 




Alice:
I can't help it. I've just done the exact same thing as you. 
  



Helen:
What! You had a bust-up with Tim?
               
			   
			   


Alice:
 No, not with Tim, with Paul.




Helen:
But why? 




Alice:
Oh I had to babysit Ellie and she just gave me the runaround. But then when 		Paul asked how it had been, I just completely lost it. I called him a bad dad and I said that she was spoiled rotten.  




Helen:
 Oh no, that's a bit harsh!




Alice:
 I know but I was so tired Helen. The words were out of my mouth before I could stop them.
			  



Helen:
 Erm, do you think it's maybe time for us to eat some humble pie?
Episode 101: Smoking in the loo


Tim:
Hurry up in there.




Khalid:
I'll be out in a minute. 
  



Tim:
Oh, it stinks in here. Khalid, have you been smoking? 
               
			   
			   


Khalid:
 Yeah but just a quick puff. 




Tim:
It doesn't matter how tiny it is, you can't smoke here.




Khalid:
Why not? It's not as if I'm smoking in the kitchen or the sitting room 			where is everyone. 




Tim:
 Rules is rules mate. Cigarettes aren't allowed and that's that.




Khalid:
 It's just cos you haven't got a job, you're hanging around the house spying 		on me.
			  



Tim:
I'm not. I'm just trying to save you the grief of the health lecture from 			Nurse Alice! 




Khalid:
Thanks Tim. I'll put the kettle on for us both, OK?
Episode 102: Friends again


Helen:
Tim, have you got a minute?




Tim:
Well, it's not like I've got a ton of things to do, is it? 
  



Helen:
No, no, it's not. Tim, I want to apologise for the way I spoke to you the other day. 
               
			   
			   


Tim:
 Oh yeah? 




Helen:
Yeah. I was well out of order. I've been having a hard time lately but that's no excuse. I'm sorry.




Tim:
Thanks Helen. Well I suppose I should say sorry too. I'm unemployed but it's not the 		end of the world. And I put you in a difficult position, asking for a discount.




Helen:
 That's OK. Would a slap-up meal make us friends again?




Tim:
 Oh go on then!
Episode 103: Helen's treat


Waitress:
And for the gentlemen?




Khalid:
I have the spaghetti. 
  



Tim:
And the cheese and tomato pizza for me. 
               
			   
			   


Waitress:
 And to drink? 




Helen:
Oh, a bottle of bubbly, thanks.



Khalid:
What do we celebrate?



Helen:
 Our anniversary. It might seem like yesterday but it's actually almost two years since Tim, Alice and I started sharing the flat. 




Tim:
 Doesn't time fly?
			  



Alice:
 A toast!
			  



Khalid:
 To friends old and new.
			  



Helen:
 We've had our ups and downs but here's to absent friends and mates right here who won't let you down.
			  



All:
 To friends!
			  



Helen:
 And don't forget, this meal's on me Tim.
			  



Tim:
 Thanks Helen. You're a real pal.
Episode 104: A mini-break* 


Alice:
Helen! I've got great news for us!




Helen:
What is it? Is there another letter from Michal? Let me see! 
  



Alice:
No, forget Michal! It's something much better! And anyway, I said 'great 	news for us'. 
So, do you remember my friend Gabrielle?
 
               
			   
			   


Helen:
 The one who lives in Paris? 




Alice:
Right! Well, she's invited us over there for a visit. So, what do you say?



Helen:
Oh, I don't know. I'm not sure Alice.



Alice:
 Come on Helen! It'll be good for you, and it'll stop you moping over Michal and his silly letter! It's Paris, the Champs Élysées, the Eiffel Tower!




Helen:
 Well, I do need to unwind a little bit and a mini-break would be fun but 		I don't know.

Episode 105: Alice swallows her pride 


Alice:
Thanks for agreeing to meet me.




Paul:
That's ok, what's on your mind?
  



Alice:
You must know. I flew off the handle the other morning and I just wanted 		to say how sorry I was. I wanted everything to go well with me and Ellie, but then she said she didn't like me and I overreacted and and ..
 
               
			   
			   


Paul:
And I was tired but that's no excuse for my behaviour either. I don't think I		realised just how badly shaken I've been since Lucy left me. I knew I was being overprotective of Ellie but I just couldn't help myself.  




Alice:
Oh Paul. What a mess we're in!



Paul:
I'm so sorry Alice. 



Alice:
 Can we try again?
Episode 106: Asking for help


Prof Lewis:
Come in Helen. How are you?




Helen:
There's no point saying 'I'm fine' is there?
  



Prof Lewis:
Not unless it's true. But I don't think you'd have made an			appointment with me if everything was OK. Am I right?
 
               
			   
			   


Helen:
As ever, Professor Lewis, as ever. 



Prof Lewis:
So what's on you mind?



Helen:
I've been neglecting my studies and I want to get back on the right 		track. 



Prof Lewis:
 Well that IS good news. What's brought on this change of heart?




Helen:
Heart's the right word. Mine is broken and I need to get over it. 
  



Prof Lewis:
So you want my help not because you're interested in your studies but simply as a way to distract you from a failed romance?
 
               
			   
			   


Helen:
No!
Episode 107: Khalid lends a hand


Alice:
Oh what are you up to today, Khalid?




Khalid:
I'm helping Helen out by taking the cat to the vets. 
  



Alice:
Oh Khalid. That's so sweet of you but...
 
               
			   
			   


Khalid:
Helen's very worried about Bronka.



Alice:
'Bronka'? Khalid listen, I don't want to talk about Helen behind her back 		but you need to know a couple of things. First off, the cat's called Kitty or Coco. It was Michal who called her Bronka. And secondly, the last time Helen was a bit down in the dumps she claimed the cat was sick then too but the vet said there was nothing wrong with her. 



Khalid:
But it might be different this time. Maybe Bronka really is ill.



Alice:
Khalid!
Episode 108: Sight-seeing


Helen:
The guidebook says 'The Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tons and is 324 metres tall'.




Alice:
Really? 
  



Helen:
Yes, but who cares about the facts and figures, let's go up!
 
               
			   
			   


Alice:
Up there? Oh it's so much nicer seeing it from the ground. Tell me 				more about this fascinating piece of architecture.



Helen:
Mmh, let's see, 'The tower can sway up to 7 centimetres in the wind.'


Alice:
Oh no! I'm definitely not going up now.



Helen:
You can't come to Paris and not go up the Eiffel Tower.




Alice:
Just watch me!




Helen:
You're not scared, are you Alice?




Alice:
The technical term is acrophobia, if you must know.




Helen:
Oh come on, take my hand. We'll go up slowly, I promise.




Alice:
No!
Episode 109: A visit to the vet


Vet:
And is Kitty an indoor or an outdoor cat?




Khalid:
Both really. She stays in at night but she's out most off the day, playing with other cats. 
  



Vet:
Right, walk along here Kitty. Now, mm, you see? She's limping. 		Let's have another look at that front paw. Ah yes, see here - there's some swelling. 
 
               
			   
			   


Khalid:
What happen?



Vet:
I'm not sure exactly but it's likely she was in a fight, probably with 		another cat, or maybe she just stood on something sharp, like a piece of glass.


Khalid:
Will she be alright?



Vet:
Oh yes. You just need to give her these antibiotics - twice a day for 		the next five days. 




Khalid:
Thanks very much.




Vet:
Ah, it's a  pleasure. Bye Kitty!
Episode 11: Phoning the landlord 


 Helen:
 Hi, dad it's Helen 


Dad:
Hello my dear, how are you? 


Helen:
 Studying hard as ever, dad. Can I ask you something as our landlord? Our lease says that we're not allowed animals in the flat. Well, is there a way that we could get around that? You see, Alice found this kitten and everyone really wants to keep her.


Dad:
You have a cat in my flat? Oh Helen, why can't you ever obey the rules? 


Helen:  Oh dad! Please, won't you bend them for me? 


Dad:
 Well... 


Helen:  Please!




Dad:
 Just this once. 


Tim:
 Kitty, did you hear what I just heard? She called the landlord "dad". What a dark horse Helen is!
Episode 110: Home again


Helen:
And then, she really did make it up to the top!




Khalid:
Congratulations Alice! You are brave!
  



Alice:
Thank you!
 
               
			   
			   


Helen:
So, how were things back here. Did you boys manage to look after 			yourselves alright?



Khalid:
We had a great time and Tim's got some good news.


Helen:
Oh what?



Tim:
My guardian angel seems to have come to my rescue once again. 




Helen:
What happened?




Tim:
Well, Janet Hall phoned to say she's got a job she thinks I might like but she wouldn't tell me what it was. She says I have to meet her so we can talk about it.




Alice:
So are you going to?




Tim:
What do you think?
Episode 111: Time for coffee


Tim:
Thanks for inviting me out for coffee. It's good to get out of the flat for a 		bit. 




Janet:
I hope you're keeping yourself busy.
  



Tim:
Well, I'm trying to but sometimes it's a bit difficult to get motivated.
 
               
			   
			   


Janet:
I know it is Tim but it's important to keep your spirits up. And I hope I can 		help on that score.



Tim:
Oh Janet, you're too kind.


Janet:
Well, what's an old gal meant to do? I see you as my special little project. 		Now, tell me honestly. What is it you want to do with your life? How would 	you like to earn a living?



Tim:
Well, you know Janet, I've always seen myself as a bit of a ...
Episode 112: A proposition


Janet:
Sorry?




Tim	:
I said 'I've always seen myself as a bit of a self-made man'.
  



Janet:
So a guy who's not afraid of hard work.
 
               
			   
			   


Tim:
Exactly! It's just that there hasn't been much hard work around lately.


Janet:
Well, what if I told you you're wrong?


Tim:
I'd love to be wrong about that.



Janet:
Well, a dear friend of mine is retiring and heading off to the sun. He's 			looking for someone to take over the reins of his small business. And I thought you might just be the man for the job.


Tim:
But how could I? I mean, I'd need some money to start with. How would I do it? A business all of my own?



Janet:
Tim. What do you say?
Episode 113: Study time


John:
Hi Helen! I haven't seen you in the library for ages. What are you doing 		here?




Helen:
I've got a ton of work from Professor Lewis and I need to make a start on 		it. I'm surprised to see you working here so late. 
  



John:
Oh I'm a changed man! Not that you'd have noticed. You've been a million 		miles away for ages. 
               
			   
			   


Helen:
Yeah. I have. So what made you knuckle down?


John:
Well, the prof gave me a good talking to about the whole photocopying 		incident.


Helen:
What did she say?



John:
Look, why don't we nip out for a coffee and I'll tell you the whole gruesome 		tale?




Helen:
Oh I shouldn't really.



John:
Come on, five minutes won't hurt!
Episode 114: Alice chats to the cat


Alice:
Oh Co-Co. I can't believe there really was something wrong with 	you all along. Your poor paw! Now how did that happen? Mm, were you fighting with that naughty tomcat in the park or did you step on some broken glass like the vet said? It must have been so sore yet I didn't believe you. Didn't believe Helen actually, if I'm being totally honest. Well I've learnt my lesson now. Listen to your friends, believe them and don't bad mouth when they're not there to defend themselves.




Helen:
Hi Alice!
  



Alice:
Helen. I didn't hear you come in. How long have you been standing there?
               
			   
			   


Helen:
Not long. Fancy a cuppa?
Episode 115: A turnaround


John:
Well, an invite to the flat. I never thought you'd ask. I'll put the kettle on 		for you, me and Alice.




Helen:
Oh perfect. Just what I need. Now I know you're desperate to tell me 			about the professor. 
  



John:
Only if you're sure. 
               
			   
			   


Helen:
Come on.


John:
Well, basically she said if I knuckled down, she'd turn a blind eye to my 		little indiscretion.  
               
			   
			   


Helen:
So have you changed?


John:
What do you think? I don't want to get kicked out! Do you?
               
			   
			   


Helen:
No! But I'm finding it hard to get back into the books.


John:
I was exactly the same. But it does get easier, eventually.
               
			   
			   


Helen:
John, can I ask you a favour?


John:
Sure.

Helen:
How would you feel about having a study-buddy?
Episode 116: Khalid's DIY


Tim:
What's all that banging about? 




Khalid:
Oh I didn't realise you were in. I thought I had the flat to myself. Do you like the new shelves? 
  



Tim:
You can't just decide to start hammering things into walls. You 	need to get permission first. Have you checked with the landlord?  
               
			   
			   


Khalid:
Of course I have. Calm down Tim. I got his number from Helen, gave him a call and he gave me the thumb up.


Tim:
Oh OK. Well in that case. Can I give you a hand?
               
			   
			   


Khalid:
Sure, I need to checking if this one is straight.


Tim:
Well, let me just put these books on it here and see if...
               
			   
			   


Khalid:
No, wait, wait!


Tim:
Sorry, was I a bit too quick?
Episode 117: Alice and Paul talk


Alice:
 Oh good evening Dr Laver. 


Paul:
 Alice, how are you? 


Alice:
 Exhausted. Just finished another long shift. 


Paul:
 Yes it's been busy here lately. 


Alice:
 I haven't seen you for ages. You're not avoiding me are you? 


Paul:
 Oh Alice. I've got such a lot on just now – juggling work and the children and half-term coming up too. There's just not enough of me to go around. I feel I'm constantly running just to stand still. 


Alice:
 Oh, I know it must be difficult but I can give you a hand. I know the babysitting wasn't great last time but I can help out in other ways. Look, how about a quick drink and we can talk about it?
Episode 118: Tim meets the owner


Tim:
Are you Henry, the owner?


Henry:
Yes. You must be Tim. Janet's told me all about you.


Tim:
Oh good things, I hope.


Henry:
Well, the key words were 'honest', 'hard-working' and 'down on his luck'.


Tim:
I couldn't have put it better myself.


Henry:
Well you can't help having a bit of bad luck now and again; that's life. But 			honesty and a willingness to graft hard? Now, those are traits you don't find every day.


Tim:
Really?


Henry:
Yes. You know, this cafe's been very good to me. I've made some great 		friends, had a lot of laughs and I've even managed to make a bob or two. So, take a deep breath and tell me, do you fancy having a go at being the boss?
Episode 119: A quiet drink


Paul:
So here's your gin and tonic. Cheers!


Alice:
Cheers! Here's to holidays. I've got a few days off next week. I can't wait for a break from work.


Paul:
That'll be nice. I wish I was as enthusiastic about half-term!


Alice:
Have you got any plans?


Paul:
Well, I've got a few activities planned for both Jake and Ellie but I have to work on Tuesday and Wednesday and I do want to spend some quality time with Jake. I think we need some father-son time alone.


Alice:
Well, I could help out there, if you like.


Paul:
How so?


Alice:
Well, maybe I could mend a few bridges with Ellie and we could have some 		girly fun at the same time.
Episode 12: After the film


Michal:Well that rom-com was much better than I expected. It was really romantic. Thank you.


Alice:
Oh, it was my pleasure.


Michal:
Would you like to do it again - go out on another date with me?


Alice: Another date? Michal, that wasn't a date we were on there.


Michal:
It wasn't? Oh, I thought it was.


Alice: No, we're just good friends.

Michal:
Yes, we are good friends and I'd like us to be better friends so I'm going to ask you: would you like to go out with me?
Episode 120: The bank manager


Manager:
So, why should the bank lend you this money?


Tim:
Well, I've been saving here for almost five years.


Manager:
But haven't you been unemployed recently?


Tim:
Yes but I've been living on my savings, not using an overdraft. I'm a 			reliable customer and I think my new business is an excellent investment. A business loan would be  good for me and good for the bank.


Manager:
Well your current account does look healthy, that's true. What about credit 		cards? Do you rely on plastic much?


Tim:
I've got one but I always pay off my balance every month.


Manager:
Well let me look at your proposal in more detail and I'll get back to you 		soon.
Episode 121: Pony riding


Ellie:
Watch me Alice! Look how fast I'm going!


Alice:
Wow! You're doing really well Ellie.


Instructor:
OK and walk! Good Dusty, good Ellie. And halt. Now, dismount Ellie. 


Ellie:
Oh that was fantastic! I love Dusty. She's the best horse in the world. Isn't		she beautiful?


Alice:
She certainly is. So have you enjoyed yourself?


Ellie:
Oh Alice it was brilliant. Thank you so much.


Alice:
Oh it's my pleasure. I'm glad you had fun. I did too.


Instructor:
OK, enough of the love-fest you two. There's a horse that needs to be 			untacked and a stable that needs mucking out. Are you ready to get to work young lady?
Episode 122: Mucking out


Instructor:
Horses have thick coats so you can brush quite hard, do you see? Do you want to try Ellie? 


Ellie:
Yes please. Oh Alice, isn't Dusty's coat gorgeous? 


Alice:
It certainly is and you're grooming her really well. 


Ellie:
Alice, can I ask you something?


Alice:
Course you can my dear.


Ellie:
Do you like me?


Alice:
Oh Ellie I think you're a lovely, smart, brave girl.


Ellie:
It's just that I was a bit naughty when you were baby-sitting me. My daddy told me off and I thought maybe you'd fallen out with me.  


Alice:
Well I was angry with you, that's true.


Ellie:
Does that mean you're not my friend? 


Alice:
No Ellie, it's just that ...


Ellie:
I'm sorry I was rude to you.
Episode 123: Painting and decorating


Helen's Dad:
The shelves look great Khalid.


Khalid:
Thank you. I enjoy working with my hands. I miss doing practical things like this when I'm studying all the time.  


Dad:
Well I have an idea which might suit us both.


Khalid:
Really, what's that?


Dad:
I hear you're not going back home over the holidays.


khalid:
Er, yes. It's too expensive and my family doesn't celebrate Chrismas in Bahrain anyway.


Dad:
Well, I was planning on doing some redecorating on one of my other flats while my tenants were away for Christmas. 


Khalid
Oh yes? 


Dad:
I could really use another pair of hands. Of course, I wouldn't expect 		you to work for free. What do you think?
Episode 124: Secret Santa


Helen:
It won't be long till Christmas is here. What does everyone want to do to 		celebrate?


Tim:
Let's do Secret Santa this year.


Khalid:
What's that?


Alice:
Well, we put everyone's name in a hat and then we each pick one out.


Tim:
But you don't say whose name you got.


Alice:
Oh yes, that's all part of the secret. So then, once you find out who your person is, you buy a Chirstmas present for them. 


Tim:
So how much are we going to spend? You see, that's all part of the Secret 		Santa too  Khalid. All of us agree to spend the same amount of money each. And it makes it more fun if we don't spend too much. So, how about a tenner?
Episode 125: Opening prezzies


Khalid:
Is everyone ready for Secret Santa before we all go our separate ways for the holidays? 


Alice:
Yes! Shall I go first? Well, I wonder what's inside this box. ... Oh a child's plastic pony. Very funny! Tim this one's for you.


Tim:
Mmm, what's this? It's soft, made of material. ... Ah! It's an apron! Perfect! Helen here's yours.


Helen:
Well, this is easy. It's a book. "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus". Is 		this supposed to help me in my not very successful love life? Khalid here's yours.


Khalid:
It's small but quite heavily. And it's very noise ... It's some nails and a new hammer! Fantastic! Thank you Secret Santa.


All:
Merry Christmas!
Episode 126: Decorating


Helen's Dad:
 Right, that undercoat seems pretty dry now. Let's get the paint ready. How many coats do you think we'll need? 


 Khalid:
Well the walls seem quite - what's the word? - porous. We might need two. 


 Dad:
So have you done much of this before?


Khalid:
My uncle's a painter and a decorator back home and I used to help him 			out during the holidays.


Dad:
Well, it's certainly nice to have some professional help for a change.


Khalid:
You know, I need to start thinking about a business project to do for my 		college work. Do you think I could write mine on this redecorating?


Dad:
I don't see why not. But who is the project manager, eh? Is it you or me?


Khalid:
Oh I think it's a joint effort, don't you?
Episode 127: An unwanted gift


Assistant:
Happy New Year madam. How can I help you?


Helen:
I'd like to return this jumper please.


Assistant:
I see. Is there anything wrong with it?


Helen:
Nothing except the colour, the shape and the size!


Assistant:
And do you have the receipt?


Helen:
No, you see it was a Christmas present.


Assistant:
Well if you just get the receipt from whoever gave you the gift, then come back to us, we'll be happy to give you a refund.


Helen:
But my mum gave it to me.


Assistant:
Can't you just ask her for the receipt then?


Helen:
Well that's the problem. My mum gives me a dreadful jumper every Christmas and I don't want to hurt her feelings.


Assistant:
Well, without a receipt there's not much I can do, sorry.
Episode 128: First day jitters


Khalid:
So it's your first day at the cafe today. What are you feeling?


Tim:
Excited and terrified!


Khalid:
You'll be fine. Don't worry.


Tim:
That's easy for you to say. You're not taking over from Mr Nice Guy.


Khalid:
Tim you're a great guy! Those people in the cafe are lucky to have someone likes you coming in to work with them.


Tim:
Oh that's nice of you to say. But what if they don't like me?


Khalid:
You're the manager. They don't have to like you. 


Tim:
But I want them to.


Khalid:
Look, just relax, be yourself. It'll be OK. Now have you got everything? Are you ready to go?


Tim:
I suppose so.


Khalid:
Chin up! Good luck, bye then!


Tim:
Bye Thanks.
Episode 129: A box of chocs


Alice:
Morning! Oh at last, I'm back home after a killer night shift.


Khalid:
Want me to put the kettle on?


Alice:
Oh thanks. You're a star! And here's a reward for making the tea!


Khalid:
What's that?


Alice:
A box of yummy chocs.


Khalid:
That's not like you, healthy nurse Alice, bringing something so naughty 	into the flat!
			
Alice:
I'm not that much of a health nut. 


Khalid:
That's not what Tim told me! 


Alice:
Oh don't believe everything he tells you! Anyway, dig in.


Khalid:
No, you first. What do you fancy?


Alice:
Oh I'll have an orange cream. Which one do you want? 


Khalid:
Toffee's my favourite. I love the way it's so mmh chewy ... oh no ... my filling's come out!

Alice:
Oh I'll call the dentist and get you an appointment right away.

Khalid:
No I hate dentists!
Episode 13: Tim spills the beans 


Tim:So how was the cinema for you two love birds?


Alice:
How many times do I have to say this - that wasn't a date! 


Tim:
Whoa, easy tiger! Hey this'll put a smile on your face. Guess who our landlord is?


Alice: How should I know? We give the money to Helen and she always sends off the cheque.


Tim:
Go on, guess. 


Alice: Tom Cruise, the man in the moon, no idea!

Tim:
It's Helen's dad!


Alice: Helen's dad! No way! Why would she keep that a secret?

Helen:
I'm just putting the kettle on. Anyone fancy a cuppa?
Episode 130: A note in the kitchen


Helen:
Hiya! Where is everyone? Mm Bronka do you know where they've all gone? I know it's Tim's first day at the cafe but Alice should be back from her night shift and Khalid doesn't go to college till later. Oh there's a note. 



'Hi Helen. Am holding Khalid's hand at the dentist. He's as scared of the drill as I am of heights. See you later, Alice. PS Help yourself to the chocolates. Don't think Khalid will be wanting any more!'



Oh scrummy!  Now, what do you think Bronka? Am I going to be good and stick to my New Year's resolution or will I just stuff my face with chocolates right now and start my diet tomorrow?
Episode 131: Confusing coffees 


Tim:
Er... right, OK. I think I've got that straight.


Customer:
Eh, good. Well, that didn't take long. Now where is Henry?


Tim:
Oh, he's on easy street now; he's retired. I'm the new Henry. I'm Tim. I've taken over from him. Nice to meet you.


Customer:
You too. I'm sure you'll work out fine. Now, if we could just have our drinks sometime before 12 o'clock today?


Tim:
Oh yeah right. Sally, can I have a er. cappuccino double and a coffee 			with low-fat milk?


Sally:
Don't you mean a double espresso and a skinny latte? Well, that's what 		they usually have.
			
Tim:
Oh Sally you're right. I will get my head round this new jargon 				soon, I promise!


Sally:
See, it's not as easy as it looks now, is it?
Episode 132: Childhood traumas


Dentist:
Now the receptionist told me you're a bit frightened of dentists. Is that right? 


Khalid:
Yes I'm terrified actually.


Dentist:
Well I hope I can change your mind about me! So first of all, let me ask you a few questions about your dental history.


Khalid:
OK, if you think it will help. 


Dentist:
I'm sure it will. Now can you remember your first visit to the dentist?


Khalid:
Yes, I was only young but I had to have a ... a filling.

Dentist:
And why was that?


Khalid:
I ate lots of sweets when I was a boy. You see, I've always loved sugary things.
               


Dentist:
Go on.


Khalid:
But the dentist didn't explain anything. He switched on the drill and when that horrible noise started, I just started screaming!
Episode 134: Tim's management style


Tim:
Oh, that was a long day Sally. Sorry you had to babysit me the whole time. I just thought it was important to get my feet wet right from the start. 


Sally:
So I saw.


Tim:
I don't know what kind of manager Henry was but I ... 


Sally:
The best. 


Tim:
Oh I should have seen that one coming! But I don't want to be him. I need to find my own way to manage. That's why I jumped in today and waited on the customers. I need to know what it's like at the coal-face. 


Sally:
Well, that's a novel way to run an empire! I don't know that all the staff will like it though.

Tim:
We'll just have to wait and see. Now how about a cuppa just for us two?
Episode 135: A mobile mystery


Alice:
So how was it?


Khalid:
I can't quite believe I'm saying this but it actually wasn't that bad!


Alice:
Really? That dentist must have been something special. Oh, sorry Khalid, excuse me. Oh it's Paul. Hello darling. Haven't heard from you in ages. What have you been up to?


Woman:
Who am I speaking to?


Alice:
I beg your pardon? Who am I? Who are you, more like it?


Woman:
No, I asked you first.


Alice:
No, you phoned me. So you must know who I am but I don't know who you are. You're calling from Dr Paul Laver's phone. Have you stolen it?


Woman:
If there's any stealing going on, it's you who's doing it.

Alice:
What are you talking about?


Woman:
Home wrecker, husband stealer!

Alice:
Mrs Laver? Lucy?
Episode 136: An empty box


Tim:
Oh chocolates, brilliant! Just what the new manager needs to get his energy level back up. Oh no! Who'd leave an empty box here just to tease me, eh Kitty?


Helen:
Hi Tim. How was your first day?


Tim:
Hard work but pretty good fun actually. You don't look great. Are you OK?


Helen:
I feel awful.


Tim:
Anything to do with this empty box of chocolates, per chance?


Helen:
How did you guess? I'm supposed to be on a diet but every time temptation comes my way, my resolve crumbles. I've got no backbone, that's my trouble.


Tim:
Oh don't be so hard on yourself.


Helen:
Easy for you to say. You can eat what you like and you never seem to put on a pound.


Tim:
That's true but why don't you ... ?
Episode 137: The elephant in the corner


Paul:
But then he said he was suddenly better and he didn't need to see me!


Alice:
Incredible! Now we can go on making small talk like this all evening if you like, but I'd rather we tackled that big old elephant in the corner. 


Paul:
What elephant is that then?


Alice:
Lucy. And before you say it, I'm not implying that your ex-wife is a big fat animal.


Paul:
Alice, I've no idea what you're talking about.


Alice:
You mean she didn't tell you?


Paul:
Didn't tell me what?


Alice:
That she used your mobile to call me and harass me. 


Paul:
I know she's having a tough time just now. She's really missing us
		all being together as a family. But she wouldn't do something like that. She'd tell me if she did.



Alice:
Paul, ...
Episode 138: Second thoughts


Alice:
Paul, you're so naive sometimes.


Paul:
I'm more realistic than you think I am Alice. 


Alice:
What?


Paul:
It's just that Lucy's having second thoughts about the divorce. 


Alice:
Well it's too late now to change her mind. You did tell her that?


Paul:
Not exactly.


Alice:
Not exactly? You're not thinking about getting back together with her?


Paul:
Well she asked me to reconsider. She said we'd had a trial separation before and maybe now it was time to think about a trial living together period; see if we could be a family again. 


Alice:
Paul!



Paul:
 We're trying to make our marriage work. It was a real one, Alice, with two lovely kids. It's them I'm thinking about.


Alice:
 But what about us?
Episode 139: The chef's hat


Chef:
And here's one egg and chips.


Tim:
Thanks. And can I have a double cheeseburger when you're ready.	Em Jack, are you sure this 	egg is cooked enough? It looks a little bit runny to me. 


Jack:
What's that on your head?


Tim:
Nothing. 


Jack:
Yeah I thought so. There's no chef's hat there, is there?


Tim:
No, of course not. I  just thought the egg looked a little bit ...


Jack:
Look! Do I think about managing the staff? Do I think about 
		timesheets and stock-taking?



Tim:
No.


Jack:
Well then, why don't you think about them, and just leave me to think about my eggs? That's my job!



Tim:
OK. Calm down Jack.


Jack:
 You know, Henry never interfered like that.


Tim:
 No I'm sure he didn't.
Episode 14: Tim strikes it rich 


Tim:Can I help you madam?


Customer: I'm looking for a man's watch.


Tim:
 Well we have a sumptuous selection here: sports, evening, everyday watches. Do you see anything you like? 


Customer:
Oh, I rather like that one. 


Tim:
	Impeccable taste, madam. Now, just take it over to the cash till there and  they'll wrap it up for you.


Customer: Thank you, goodbye.

Tim:
Goodbye...Oh, you've dropped something madam. Madam! Oh she's gone. Let's see 50, 100, 150 pounds! Well you know what they say Tim, a fool and her money..
Episode 140: Which sport?


Khalid:
What are you up to?


Helen:
Oh, just looking at what's on offer at the sports centre.


Khalid:
How come?


Helen:
Well I promised myself that I was going to get fit. I want to do a 	sport. I just don't know which one.  


Khalid:
Well, have you thought about if you like team sports or individual ones?


Helen:
I don't mind really. 


Khalid:
Do you like swimming or diving? 



Helen:
Neither, I can't swim!


Khalid:
What about martial arts, boxing or weightlifting? 



Helen:
Can you see me doing any of them?


Khalid:
No, not really. Well what sports do you like watching then? 


Helen:
 I really enjoyed the tennis when I went to Wimbledon last summer. 


Khalid:
 So maybe a racquet sport then?


Helen:
 Perfect! But which one?
Episode 141: Late again


Jack:
Hiya Sally. Hello Tim.


Sally:
Right, I'm off. I have to run or I'll be late for college. Bye!


Tim:
Bye Sally! So Jack, what time do you call this? This is your third late appearance this week.


Jack:
I'm only 10 minutes late.  


Tim:
10 minutes makes a lot of difference to Sally. 


Jack:
Oh Sally, Sally, Sally. That's all I ever hear around here. 


Tim:
Well, maybe if you worked as hard as she did, you'd hear your name a bit more.  



Jack:
And maybe if you stopped getting on my wick, I'd want to come in a bit more. I might even turn up on time.


Tim:
Punctuality isn't an optional extra, you know. If you're late one more time, I'll ...



Jack:
You'll what?


Tim:
I'll ...
Episode 142: Booking a court


Manager:
Hello Sports World. How can I help you?


Helen:
Do you have any courts free for Monday evening at 7.30 please? 


Manager:
Oh yes, we have plenty available then. 


Helen:
Good. And can we hire racquets and balls at the court?


Manager:
Oh yes, we can provide you with all that. Now, how many courts do 		you want to book?


Helen:
Can you hang on for a minute? OK guys listen. I'm just booking the court for Alice and me. So for the last time, are you two in as well?  


Tim:
Oh I don't know, it's been years since I've played tennis.



Khalid:
But it would be fun. The girls against the boys and a few games 		of mixed doubles. How about it Tim?
Episode 143: Marriage vows


Paul:
So, how are you?


Alice:
Not great. I've been thinking about us a lot. And you know what?


Paul:
What? 


Alice:
I think Lucy's right. If there's any way you two can save your 			marriage, you've got to give it a go. 


Paul:
I know that's the right thing to do but a part of me just wants to say "No!" She was the one who left me! 


Alice:
I know but vows are vows. 


Paul:
Can we still be friends?



Alice:
No. I don't think so Paul. 


Paul:
We're both adults. Surely we can break up and still be friends.



Alice:
I've got enough friends. I was looking for something else with you. And if I can't have that, well, I just don't think I can see you 			anymore. Goodbye Dr Laver.
Episode 144: A call from China


Helen's mum:
So how are you my dear? 


Helen:
Pretty good mum.

That's nice to hear. I know it's been difficult getting over that boy Michal. But I've noticed that you seem a bit more cheerful these days. You're working harder at uni. And you've got that nice boy John to help you too.  


Helen:
Yeah, I suppose that's true. So what's new with you?


Mum:
Well your grandma phoned me the other day. She really wants you to go over to Beijing and visit her soon. 


Helen:
Oh I'd love to see laolao. 


Mum:
But the flight to China is expensive. I'm not sure if we can afford it just now. I need to talk it over with your father.



Helen:
Please mum! Please!

How was your day Tim?

Awful! I can see I've got a right handful with Jack, the chef.


Khalid:
What's the problem?


Tim:
Well, he turned up late again and he really seemed annoyed when I took him to task about it. 


Khalid:
So you're having a trouble asserting your authority as a manager, are you?


Tim:
Exactly!


Khalid:
Well, we've been study employee relations at college this week. Maybe some of my notes could help you. 



Tim:
Fantastic Khalid. That's just what I need. How can I thank you?


Khalid:
Well, I'm just finishing my project report about working with Helen's dad. Would you check it to see if I've made any mistakes?  



Tim:
No problems mate. And who knows? I might even learn a thing or two in the process!
Episode 146: A chat about money


Helen's dad:
Hi, how are my two favourite girls then?


Helen's mum:
Perfect. We were just having some girly time together. 


Dad:
Oh sorry to cramp your style.


Helen:
No, don't worry dad. Actually you've come home just at the right time. Hasn't he mum?


Mum:
Well yes. We were talking about Helen having a trip to China this summer.


Dad:
Do you think I'm made of money? The Olympics will be on then. A  flight to Beijing will cost a fortune!


Mum:
And that's why I think there should be some strings attached. One, 	Helen gets down to some serious work at university. Two, she passes all her exams. And three, she pays something towards her fare. 



Dad:
Well that seems like a reasonable arrangement to me. What do you think Helen?
Episode 147: Being professional


Helen:
Aren't you changing for tennis, Alice?


Alice:
Oh, I'm not feeling very sporty. Can you find someone else to make up the numbers? 


Helen:
No I can't. I've booked the court. Come on.


Alice:
I'm knackered. I've had a hard day. I think I just need a quiet night in.


Helen:
There's something else, isn't there? 


Alice:
I saw Paul today.


Helen:
You see him all the time at work. 



Alice:
We discussed some patients and I took careful notes on their treatment programmes. I was extremely professional.


Helen:
Course you were. And then he asked you out tonight. And now
		you want to bail out on me.




Alice:
We've split up and ... 


Helen:
What?
Episode 148: In Alice's shoes


Alice:
We've split up and ... I hate working with him.


Helen:
I'm not surprised. When did you break up?


Alice:
A few days ago.


Helen:
Why didn't you tell me?


Alice:
 I kept hoping he'd call to say he'd made a mistake. 


Helen:
But he didn't.


Alice:
He's gone back to Lucy.



Helen:
His wife who walked out on him? Alice, he's got no backbone. You're better off without him.


Alice:
Do you really think so?




Helen:
Yes and I think it's time for some drastic action. Some fresh air, a few friends and an hour or two of not thinking about him. I've been in your shoes and I know what I'm talking about. I insist you come out with us now.


Alice:
Oh don't make me!
Episode 149: Mixed doubles


Tim:
40-15. I'll serve this one out wide Alice. You keep close to the net. That's Helen's weakness. The match is ours if I can hold this serve. 


Alice:
Show no mercy partner.


Khalid:
What's our strategic here?


Helen:
I'm just trying to get the ball over the net. 


Khalid:
 Who knew they would be so good? 


Helen:
Talk about hiding your light under a bushel. It's not fair!


Tim:
When you're ready.



Helen:
Go for it.


Khalid:
Out! 40-30.




Alice:
It was in. I saw it.


Khalid:
Alice it bounced right beside me. It was out a mile.


Tim
OK. No point getting het up Alice. Second serve. 


Helen
Too fast for me. 


Tim
6-2, 6-1. We are the champions!


Helen
Congratulations. See Alice, I told you you'd enjoy yourself.


Alice
Thanks Helen. I just wish work was this easy.
Episode 15: A heart-to-heart 


Helen:
Hello?


Alice:
Hi Helen. 


Helen:
What's up Alice?


Alice:
It's so quiet at work I thought I'd give you a ring. A little bird told me that the landlord is your dad!


Helen:
How did you find out? 


Alice: Never mind about that. Why have you been keeping it a secret for so long?

Helen:
Well because as soon as people know how rich my parents are, they start treating me differently. When you and Tim came to live here I wanted to start afresh so I decided not to tell anyone.


Alice: Oh Helen you're such a silly goose! I promise, it won't make any difference to us! So no more secrets OK?  

Helen:
OK then.
Episode 150: A wild tale


Jack:
Sorry I'm late boss but you wouldn't believe the journey I've had.


Tim:
I'm running round like a headless chicken here. I don't have time to listen to any more of your wild tales Jack.


Jack:
It's not a tale, it's the truth. Just listen.


Tim:
The time for listening is over. I told you last week what would happen if you were late again.


Jack:
 But there was an accident ...


Tim:
I'm going to have to let you go.


Jack:
You can't fire me!



Tim:
Jack, it's time to pack up your apron and try your luck in some other kitchen.


Jack:
You'll regret this. Don't you know who I am?
                 



Tim:
Don't make me laugh.


Jack:
You'll be laughing on the other side of your face after I make a phone call.
Episode 151: A lovely mother


Alice:
Matron asked me to look after you today.


Molly:
Thanks Alice. It's always a bit nerve-wracking, the first day on a new ward. 


Alice:
Don't worry, we don't bite! ... Oh, Doctor Laver, this is Molly.


Dr Laver:
Ah, our new nurse. Let's do the rounds so I can see you in action. 


Molly:
Right Doctor. I've never had to look after such young babies before. I'm quite nervous really.


Dr Laver:
Nothing to it. Just pick one up and have a nice little chat.


Molly:
Ah, hello there baby-face. What have you been up to today?



Dr Laver:
See? You're a natural. I'm sure you'll make a lovely mother one day Molly. 


Alice:
Oh, what a creep! He said those exact words to me! I thought he was being genuine. Should have realised he was just using some phoney chat up line.
Episode 152: A blast from the past


Tim:
So, what's new with you Henry?


Henry:
I don't quite know how to put this. It's very awkward.


Tim:
Come on, you can tell me. 


Henry:
 It's about a young relative of mine. I hate to ask but I was wondering if you might give him a job.


Tim:
Well being related to you is a great reference for a start. Any experience in the catering trade?


Henry:
He's worked as a chef actually.


Tim:
Perfect! Where? Any place I'd have heard of?



Henry:
Your very own establishment Tim. It's my young and rather head-strong nephew Jack I'm talking about.


Tim:
Henry!  You don't ask for much, do you? 	
                 



Henry:
Please, give him one more chance. For me? 


Tim:
I'm between a rock and a hard place. I'll need to think it over.
Episode 153: Revision time


John:
Ready for our revision quiz?


Helen:
Oh, I hope so. 


John:
OK, let's get cracking. Right, erm ... give me three examples of resources. 


Helen:
 Time, money and skill. 


John:
Very good. And what does the law of demand state?


Helen:
That generally price and quantity demanded in a market are inversely related.


John:
Which, in normal language, means?



Helen:
Oh, erm ... as the price of something goes up, fewer people demand it or want it. 


John:
Oh you're on a roll now. You'll do fine in your test.
                 



Helen:
If I don't, Prof Lewis will kill me!


John:
And don't forget there's a plane ticket in the balance too. 	
                 



Helen:
Don't remind me. I promised my dad I'd get more than 90% in this test. Hope I wasn't too rash.
Episode 154: A change of scenery


Matron:
So what's brought on this request for a transfer Alice?


Alice:
Oh nothing in particular, Matron.  


Matron:
 You've been doing so well with the new borns. You really seem to have the knack with them. And we get great feedback about you from the parents too.


Alice:
I do enjoy that part of my job - you know, helping the mums and dads.  


Matron:
So if you're not unhappy, why do you want to get away from us all of a sudden? 


Alice:
I just think I'd like to get more experience of different types of nursing.


Matron:
Aren't you forgetting how varied the work is here on the children's ward? I'm sorry but we're incredibly short-staffed at the moment as you know. So I think I'll have to turn down your request for now.
Episode 155: Helen's results


John: 
Oh the prof's putting the exam results up on the noticeboard.


Helen:
I don't know if I can bear to look. 


John:
What are you worried about? You did plenty of revision. 


Helen:
I know. It's just that the things I studied didn't come up on the test. 


John:
Well you won't find out your mark dawdling about here. 


Helen:
Why don't you go and find out how we did?


John:
I'm not the one with a summer holiday on the line.  



Prof L:
It looks like your new studying scheme is working out for you both. 


John:
You mean we passed?



Prof L:
Congratulations!


Helen:
That's great but actually I'm looking for a much higher score than just a pass.	 


Prof L:
Would being top of the class with 96% make you happy? 


Helen:
Ecstatic! Beijing, here I come!
Episode 156: Jack's back


Tim: 
And why exactly should I interview you?


Jack:
Because I'm an experienced chef and that's what you're looking for.
                          


Tim:
But I don't want someone who threatens me and goes behind my back snivelling to influential relatives when he can't take responsibility for his actions.  


Jack:
I was desperate to keep my job. 


Tim:
But how do you think you made me feel, talking to your uncle Henry?


Jack:
Humiliated. I'm sorry Tim. I shouldn't have pulled rank. I just didn't want to have to tell my parents I'd stuffed up once again. 


Tim:
So you want to be able to hold down a job and hold your head up high. I want a chef I can rely on. I can keep my side of the bargain. Can you keep yours?
Episode 157: Flying 
                            to China


Crew 1: 
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, this is your First Officer again. We will shortly be starting our descent into Beijing. The weather is reported to be cloudy, with a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. We expect to land at 3.20pm, local time.


Passenger 1:
It's so exciting. 
                          


Helen:
Is this your first time to China?


Passenger 1:
Yes, we're on our honeymoon.


Helen:
Oh, congratulations!


Passenger 2:
Thanks. Do you live in Beijing?


Helen:
No but my grandma does. I'm visiting her. Are you over for the Olympics?


Passenger 1:
We've got tickets for some of the track events but we do want to do plenty of sightseeing too. What would you recommend?


Helen:
Well it depends what you're after. Look, why don't I give you my	number and if you'd like some local colour, maybe I could help you out?
Episode 158: At 
                            the Forbidden City


Frank: 
It's amazing to think this was built over 500 years ago.


Rose:
The colours are so vibrant. 
                          


Helen:
Do you know that each one is a symbol?


Frank:
In what way? Isn't yellow just yellow?


Helen:
No Frank. Yellow was the colour of the Emperor so practically all the roofs in the palace are yellow.


Frank:
Practically? Which ones aren't?


Helen:
The library at the Pavilion of Literary Profundity has black tiles because black was associated with water and so people thought it would help prevent fires. 


Frank:
This sight-seeing is making me hungry. Helen would you like to come out for dinner with us tonight?


Rose:
Let us treat you, as a thank you for all you've done for us in Beijing.


Helen:
That would be lovely Rose. What do you fancy? I've got a few ideas.
Episode 159: Chinese food


Frank: 
It's really lovely to meet your grandma finally.


Grandma:
Nimen hao.



Rose:
Ni hao laolao.


Helen:
Your Chinese is improving all the time Rose.


Rose:
We'd never have come this far from our hotel without you Helen. Thanks for bringing us to the night market.


Frank:
Everything looks delicious. I don't know where to start. What's this?


Helen:
You might want to give that one a miss.


Rose:
Come on! We're game for anything!


Helen:
Even testicles?


Frank:
Mmm, maybe another time.


Grandma:
Chuan zai Faguo, zhu zai Meiguo, chi zai Zhongguo.


Rose:
My Chinese isn't that good yet. What did your grandma say?


Helen:
It's an old Chinese saying - 'Fashion is in France, living is in America, but eating is in China!'


Frank:
Isn't that the truth!
Episode 16: A kitchen romance 


Michal:
Oh Bronka! I'm so miserable! Alice doesn't want to go out with me.


Helen:
Oh sorry, Michal. Am I interrupting something here?


Michal:
 No, no, I'm just pouring my heart out to Bronka.


Helen:
Oh yeah, I found out that Alice gave you a knock-back but it's not the end of the world. There are plenty more fish in the sea you know. 


Michal:
Fish? I don't want a fish, I want a date!


Helen:
Well, there's someone right in front of you!


Michal:
You're always too busy studying. You wouldn't go out with a guy like me.


Helen:
Oh wouldn't I? Why don't you ask first!

Michal:
Would you?


Helen:
I'd love to!
Episode 160: Home sweet home


Tim: 
Hey, welcome back Helen. How was China?


Helen:
Fantastic! 


Tim:
How was laolao?


Helen:
She was on great form. I miss her so much already. 


Tim:
Did you see any of the Games?


Helen:
I watched a bit of them on TV. 


Tim:
Helen! I don't believe you! 


Helen:
Well there was so much else to see and do. I made some really good friends over there and we were just so busy all the time.


Tim:
I hope you haven't forgotten about your friends back here. It's Khalid's birthday next week, remember?


Helen:
Have we bought him anything yet? 


Tim:
No but Alice and I were talking about it and we thought we could take him out somewhere special. 


Helen:
Sounds great. Where were you thinking of?
Episode 161: Khalid's birthday 


Tim: 
Happy Birthday Khalid! Are you ready  to blow out your candles?



Helen:
Don't forget to make a wish. 


Khalid:
I wish that …


Tim
No! Don't say it out loud. It won't  come true then.


Khalid
Oh, OK. 


All:
One, two, three … Hey, well done, congratulations! 


Tim:
Here's a card from us all. 


Helen:
And here's a present, from me.


Khalid:
Thanks you guys. Really you shouldn't  have. Oh, a jumper.  That's lovely Helen, thanks.


Tim:
 I think I recognise  that top, Helen! Isn't that the jumper your  mum gave you for Christmas?


Helen:
 I couldn't possibly comment. 


Tim:
What an excellent idea, giving your  cast-offs as presents.


Helen:
Well that's not what I'd call it. I  believe the word you're searching for  is "re-gift".


Tim:
Helen, you crafty devil!
Episode 162: Ten-pin 
                            bowling


Khalid: 
Oh, I don't believe it! I've missed 
                            again. I'm useless at this.


Tim:
You've got to bowl it straight down 
                            the middle. 


Khalid:
That's what I'm trying doing, but it 
                            just goes off to the side.


Tim:
Well, don't forget to follow through 
                            with your bowling arm. Like this ...  
                            Yes! 


Helen:
Aren't you the expert? Khalid, try 
                            using a heavier ball. Have another go now.


Khalid:
Okay. I'll try using this one.


Helen:
Tim, where's Alice? She should be here 
                            by now. Did you remember to give her the address of 
                            this bowling alley?


Tim:
Well, I remember telling her we were 
                            going bowling, but I'm not sure I mentioned where. 
                            Sorry!


Helen:
Oh, Tim! You idiot! She'll kill you. 
                            She's probably gone to the other alley. Give her a 
                            ring now! 


Khalid:
Yes! A strike! What a great birthday!
Episode 163: The 
                            wrong conclusion


Tim: 
That's strange. The door's locked. Jack's supposed to be here early.


Jack:
Hi Tim. Good to see you.


Tim:
What are you doing? You were meant to come early to prepare that 		big lunch order for the bank.


Jack:
But I...


Tim:
No buts. And no third chances.


Jack:
You're jumping to the wrong conclusion.


Tim:
The wrong conclusion?! You're late. When I took you on again you 		promised to work harder. Henry or no Henry, you are...


Jack:
Don't say it, Tim. Listen, I was at the bank.


Tim:
The bank? Why?


Jack:
To deliver the lunch order.


Tim:
The lunch order? What do you mean?


Jack:
I came early, made the lunch order, then delivered it. I thought it 		would be good customer service.


Tim:
Oh, I see. Right, well, there's only one thing I can say...
Episode 164: A new bathroom?


Helen: 
Sorry I missed your call the other week, Dad. We were out 			ten-pin bowling, for Khalid's birthday.


Dad:
Did you have a good time?


Helen:
It was great, except Alice was let down by Tim, and she still 			isn't speaking to him!


Dad:
Oh dear. Is that causing problems in the flat?


Helen:
Well, a few, but...


Dad:
I see, well, I wanted to talk about the flat.


Helen:
Uh-huh...


Dad:
I think the flat should be modernised. I'm going to put in a
			new bathroom and kitchen.


Helen:
Wow, that's great!


Dad:
I hope so, but it means you all have to move out while
			the redecoration work is being done.


Helen:
Move out? Can't we stay here during the work?


Dad:
I'm not sure. Do you think that's realistic?
Episode 165: Teamwork


Tim: 
Jack, have you got a moment?


Jack:
What have I done wrong now?


Tim:
No, no, no. It's nothing like that. Can I help you in the kitchen?
		I think I should know more about what you do. It could make us 		more of a team.


Jack:
Teamwork! OK, well grab an apron and peel some spuds.


Tim:
This is quite hard work, isn't it?


Jack:
Sure is! Now, dice the potatoes so we can use them in the pies. 		Then you need to chop the onions, that'll bring tears to your eyes!


Tim:
Actually Jack, I think there's a customer in the café. Keep up the 		good work!


Jack:
Oh, right, see you later. I guess a little teamwork is better than 		none.
Episode 166: Holding a grudge


Tim: 
I'm just putting the kettle on Alice. Em, fancy a brew? 


Alice:
Humph! 


Tim:
Is  that a 'yes'?


Alice:
Sorry  Co-Co, did you hear someone speak? 


Tim:
Oh Alice,  come on. 


Alice:
I'm not talking to you Tim. 


Tim:
We can't go on like this – you giving me the cold shoulder every time our paths cross in the kitchen. 


Alice:
I  don't see why not. 


Tim:
Because we're friends and mates don't let mates hold a grudge forever. I'm sorry Alice. It was, it was an honest mistake.


Alice:
You  left me hanging about at the bowling alley like Billy-no mates. It was embarrassing.


Tim: 
If I  promise never to do it again, will you forgive me? 


Alice:
Maybe.  But it'll take more than a cup of tea to get you completely off the hook.
Episode 167: The phone bill


Tim: 
Here's the mail.


Helen:
Another bill I bet you. Everyone ready to stump up their quarter 		share of the phone bill? 


Alice:
What's the damage?


Helen:
A hundred and sixty-three pounds, eighty-seven pence!


Tim:
That can't be right.


Alice:
That's about hundred pounds more than our usual bill. 


Khalid:
Yeah, but with the crunchy credit and everything, our bills were bound to start getting higher.


Alice:
Yes but not this high.


Helen:
There are a lot of international calls here.


Alice:
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Bahrain, Saudi. Khalid, are these calls all yours?


Khalid:
I was feeling homesick on my birthday.


Tim:
That's fine mate. Now we know who has to foot the bill.


Khalid:
But I thought you said we always shared the bills evenly in this flat...?
Episode 168: Relocation


Alice: 
Great. Thanks, see you soon. Bye.


Tim:
Good news? 
                          


Alice:
I've  got somewhere to stay while the flat's getting redecorated - a place in the nurses' 		home. I'm sharing with six 		others though.


Tim:
Maybe all this breakfast making won't be good for you. You won't know how to fend for 		yourself with all those other nurses around.


Alice:
Thank you for that interesting observation. Now, keep frying those 		eggs!


Tim:
Yes, ma'am!


Khalid:
You're lucky you've got somewhere to go.


Alice:
Aren't you staying with a college friend?


Khalid:
Dan was fine about it but his flatmates didn't want me sleeping on 		the couch for two whole weeks.


Tim:
Fancy a fortnight with my folks on the farm, Khalid?


Khalid:
I've never actually seen a cow or a hen or a horse. Maybe a hotel 		would suit me better.
Episode 169: The wish list


Helen: 
Dad says we should make a wish-list for the redecorating.


Tim:
The kitchen walls could really do with a lick of paint. 
                          


Helen:
Yeah, there are quite a few tomato stains from all your great Italian 		cooking Tim!


Tim:
Art comes at a price, you know.


Alice:
Yes, chef. A power-shower would be fantastic.


Tim:
There's nothing really wrong with the one we've got, is there?


Alice:
Well, I suppose it works OK.


Khalid:
And we need to think about the environment too Alice. Doesn't a 		power-shower use more energy?


Alice:
You did say wish list, didn't you Helen?


Khalid:
How about a dish-washer?


Tim:
A stroke of genius, Khalid!


Helen:
Could this be the end of fights over the washing-up?


Alice:
And environmentally friendly too, eh Khalid?
Episode 17: Booking tickets*




 Agent:
 Good morning, London Attractions.


 Michal:
 I'd like to book two tickets for next week. For River Boat cruise please. 


Agent:
 OK. When?


 Michal:
Next Thuesday.


Agent:
 Sorry?


Michal:
 Thuesday.

Agent:
 I'm sorry sir, is that Tuesday the first or Thursday the third? 

Michal:
 Thursday the third. 

Agent:
Right, and what time would you like?

Michal:
 In an evening.

Agent:
 Because it's winter, the last trip is at 7.00. Is that OK? 

Michal:
 Yes thanks.

Agent:
 OK, just let me put you on hold for a moment please.

Episode 170: Plans for the cafe


Tim: 
Jack, Sally, can you come here for a minute?


Jack:
What is it? 
                          


Sally:
What's up?


Tim:
You know my flat is getting redecorated?


Sally:
Yes.


Tim:
Well, I'm moving back to my parents. And they live too far away 		for me to be able to come in to the cafe for the next couple of 			weeks. So we need to decide what you're both going to do while 		I'm away.


Jack:
We could close the cafe and all have a holiday.


Tim:
That's sounds like fun.


Sally:
Yes, but would our loyal customers find somewhere else to get their 		cuppa and then never come back to us when we reopen?	 How 			about appointing one of us to be the manager?


Tim:
Interesting ideas. Both of them. Let me think them over.
Episode 171: Packing up


Khalid: 
The flat seems so quiet without Alice and Helen.


Tim:
It'll be even quieter when we head out of here soon. 
                          


Khalid:
Now, are you sure you've got everything Tim?


Tim:
I think so but I get the feeling I'm missing something important.


Khalid:
You've got two huge suitcases. What can you possibly have leaved 		out?


Tim:
That's the trouble. If I knew what it was, I'd be able to 			pack it.


Khalid:
Let me see if I can run your memory. Have you packed your 			clothes?


Tim:
Yes.


Khalid:
Looks like you've got enough to last you a month! Keys?



Tim:
Yeah got them here.


Khalid:
So what can you have forgotten?


Tim:
Hi Kitty. Of course, Kitty!


Khalid:
Kitty! Tim how could she have slipped your mind?


Tim:
Don't tell the Helen and Alice, please! They'll kill me!
Episode 172: Checking in


Receptionist: 
How can I help you sir?


Khalid:
I have a reservation. Khalid Al Ahmadi. 
                          


Receptionist:
Let's see. Yes, we have a twin-bed with a bath ready for you.


Khalid:
But I asked for a single with a shower.


Receptionist:
	I'm sorry but I didn't get that message. Are you sure that's what 		you booked?


Khalid:
Yes I'm sure.


Receptionist:
Well I'm afraid we don't have any singles available just now.


Khalid:
Is the double more expensive?


Receptionist:
Yes, £15 more, per night. But we should have a single for you 			tomorrow.



Khalid:
Well... this mistake isn't my fault. I did book a single. I hope you 		won't be charging me extra.


Receptionist:
I'm afraid it's out of my hands sir.


Khalid:
Well in that case...
Episode 173: How's Kitty?


Tim:
Hi Helen.


Helen:
How are you Tim?


Tim:
Fantastic. Enjoying being spoiled rotten by my folks.


Helen:
Yeah, I know what you mean.


Tim:
There's nothing like a bit of home cooking, is there?


Helen:
I just can't resist the dumplings my mum makes.

Tim:
It's the treacle sponge here that's my undoing.


Helen:
Tell me about it! I'm scared to step on the scales.


Tim:
Hey, I've got someone here who wants a word with you.


Helen:
Who is it?


Tim:
A friend from the flat who's missing you madly.


Helen:
Oh Bronka! How are you? Is Tim feeding you properly?

Tim:
Of course I am Helen! You don't think I could ever neglect...

Helen:
What did you say?


Tim:
Forget... I said I could never forget Kitty!


Helen:
Really?


Tim:
What do you think?
Episode 174: Meeting the manager


Manager:
You wanted a word with me?


Khalid:
Yes, I want to cancel my booking.


Manager:
Oh I hope I can change your mind. What seems to be the 			trouble?


Khalid:
Well first, you mixed up my booking. 


Manager:
We've just got a new booking system in place. It's giving us a few 		teething problems.


Khalid:
But that's not my fault, is it?

Manager:
Of course not sir. I just wanted to point out that Christine isn't 			entirely to blame.


Khalid:
But it's not right that I should have to pay more because of this 		mix up. 


Manager:
I hear what you're saying sir.


Khalid:
Good. I'm glad you're seeing sense. Because there are plenty of 		other hotels that want my business.


Manager:
Couldn't we come to some sort of compromise here?


Khalid:
What did you have in mind?
Episode 175: Trouble at the cafe


Jack:
What?


Tim:
Is everything alright Jack?


Jack:
No Tim everything is not alright. I've just opened up 				the cafe and the place is completely flooded! There's 				water everywhere, and, and, and other stuff too. Yuk! It's going all over my shoes!


Tim:
Ok, don't panic. 


Jack:
I'm not panicking.


Tim:
Look, where's Sally?

Jack:
We don't need Sally. I'm in charge today.


Tim:
It doesn't sound as if you are. 


Sally:
Hello Jack! Oh-oh!


Tim:
Is that Sally? Let me have a word with her?


Sally:
Tim hi. It looks like the fridge has packed in. There's 				milk, water, orange juice all over the floor. We'll get 				it cleaned up, I'll phone the electrician and we'll just 				need to order a new bunch of supplies. Ok?


Tim:
Perfect Sally. What would I do without you, eh?
Episode 176: A hospital Christmas


Alice:
Right, all the decorations are up in the ward. Time to wrap the 			presents and sort out the crackers.


Matron:
You're doing such a splendid job, Alice.


Alice:
Thank you. I've always loved organising Christmas parties and I 		want this to be a really fun time for the kids, to take their minds off 		being in hospital.


Matron:
Well, in my book, anything that's good for a patient's psychology is 		good for their biology! But, I'm afraid I have some bad news. 


Alice:
Oh, what's happened?


Matron:
You see there's a staff shortage on another ward. We need you to 		work there for a while.

Alice:
Oh, when?


Matron:
Right now. 


Alice:
But we're about to have the party.


Matron:
I'm sorry Alice, but there's no choice.
Episode 177: New Year's fireworks


Alice:
Hey girls,  let's stand here. We'll get a great view of the fireworks.


Nurse Molly:
Okay.  Who's got the champagne?


Nurse Liz:
Me.  Shall I open it now?


Alice:
Oh  no, wait till the big moment. It's so great to be out with you all. Thanks for being so lovely this  Christmas. I don't know what I would've  done without you.


Liz:
It's  been great getting to know you too, Alice.  We wouldn't have  had  anywhere near such a good Christmas if you hadn't been there  to cook the turkey! 


Alice:
We  had a lovely time, didn't we? I wish I hadn't missed my ward's Christmas party though. Still,  I've had fun in the end.

Molly:
And  here's wishing you more fun for the New Year!


Liz:
Here we  go everyone ... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1


Everyone:
Happy New Year!
Episode 178: Catching up


Alice:
So, in the end, I had a great time. I went out with the girls on New Year's Eve. The fireworks went down really well with everyone, as did the champagne! But enough about me, how was your Christmas and New Year?


Helen:
Fine, fine, except I went down with 'flu on Christmas Eve.


Alice:
No way!


Helen:
Yes, and I went right off my food. I felt so bad as my mum had made a real effort with the dinner.


Alice:
What a shame. What about New Year?

Helen:
That was better thanks. I just stayed in with all the family and watched TV, you know. Have you heard from Tim and Khalid?


Alice:
No. I was going to ask you the same thing. I wonder why they haven't called.
Episode 179: Paying the bill


Khalid:
I'd like to check out now please.


Manager:
Certainly sir. Was everything satisfactory?


Khalid:
Not really, no. You mixed up my booking, I ordered a vegetarian 		breakfast but was given steak and eggs, and the hot water in my 		shower didn't work in the mornings.


Manager:
Yes, I know you had a few problems but really, the important 			thing is, would you say they were dealt with politely and 				efficiently?


Khalid:
No, I would say they were dealt with completely unpolitely and non-efficiently, actually. I had to ask more than three times to have my 		shower fixed and the waiter was very rude when I asked him to 		change my food.

Manager:
Well, can I offer you a further discount as compensation? Say, 15%?


Khalid:
Oh... Thank you.
Episode 18: Emergency


 Alice:
 Oh it's so quiet tonight! You could hear a pin drop. Gives me a chance to catch up on my reading. 


 Man:
 Quick, quick! Get a doctor!


 Alice:
 She's just gone for a break. What's the matter?


 Man:
 I don't know. It's my son. He's stopped breathing. 


 Alice:
 Oh no! Wait a minute, I'll just phone for the doctor. 


Man:
 There's no time. You have to give him mouth to mouth.

 Alice:
 But I haven't done it before! 

Man:
 You haven't done it before?

 Alice:
 No, not for real. Wait while I find the phone.

Man:
 No! No, you must do it now!
Episode 180: Breakfast on the farm


Tim's mum: 
Good morning Khalid!


Khalid: 
Morning Mrs Hunter. Thanks for inviting me to stay here.


Tim:
We couldn't have you staying another day in that dreadful hotel. 		Sleep well Khalid? 
                          


Khalid:
I don't know who said the countryside is quiet.


Tim:
The birds can make quite a racket in the morning.


Mum:
How do you like your eggs, Khalid?


Khalid:
Scrambled please.


Tim:
Oh, me too mum.


Mum:
Coming right up. So what are you boys up to today?


Tim:
I thought you'd like to give me a hand with the chores Khalid.



Khalid:
Chores?


Tim:
Well, where do you think these lovely eggs come from and the milk 		in your coffee?


Khalid:
The supermarket?


Tim:
Khalid! I think it's time for you to...


Khalid:
Pardon?
Episode 181: A tour of the farm


Tim: 
I said ... it's time for you to  see where your 		food comes from.


Khalid: 
Do I have to?


Tim:
Of course you do. Come on! 
                          


Khalid:
OK then. Lead the way Tim!


Tim:
So this is where we keep the chickens.              Want to see if there are any eggs ready? 



Khalid:
Not really. Why don't you look? 


Tim:
We're too late for them now. Dad was out ages ago getting the 			fresh ones.         


Khalid:
Eh, tomorrow then?


Tim:
I'll hold you to that. Want to meet Bessie?



Khalid:
Who's that?


Tim:
The cow you're going to milk later. 


Khalid:
No chance, no way!


Tim:
Come on Khalid. What's the point of coming to a farm if you're not 		going to have a go at farming?
Episode 182: The global economy


Helen: 
Dad, are you finished at the flat yet?


Dad: 
Almost. You know I've been meaning to talk to you about it. 


Helen:
What is it dad?  
                          


Dad:
Now don't take that tone with me young lady.


Helen:
Dad!



Dad:
I'm warning you. 


Helen:
I'm sorry dad. So, what do you want to talk to me about?


Dad:
Well the flat renovation was going really well.


Helen:
Was?
						


Dad:
The kitchen has been totally transformed and Khalid's bedroom has been given a great make-over. 


Helen:
I feel a but coming on.



Dad:
Well the downturn in the economy has affected us all. 


Helen:
Yes, yes but what about the flat? 


Dad:
Well let's just say the finances did not quite stretch to the sitting 		room.
Episode 183: Milking the cows


Khalid: 
Are you sure it's safe to let me do this?


Tim: 
Of course it is. We've got machines that do most of the milking 			nowadays but I thought you'd like to give it a go by hand. 


Khalid
If you insist.  
                          


Tim:
So watch me. Lean in near Bessie...


Khalid:
Ok, that looks easy enough.



Tim:
Hold on to one of her teats, firmly and... squeeze down, and squeeze down.	And that's all there is to it. Ready?



Khalid:
Ok Bessie. Be gentle with me... Hey!	I've got it. I'm milking, I'm milking!



Tim:
Ah, good on you Khalid. Now just keep concentrating. And keep your 		eye on her back leg.


Khalid:
This is great! What?
						


Tim:
I said watch out for her... Well,  I suppose there's...
Episode 19: Tim's reward


 Tim:
 Hello I'm calling from McCarthy's. I helped you when you were looking at watches the other day. 


 Customer:
 Yes? 


 Tim:
 I think I've found something of yours. Have you lost anything? 


 Customer:
 Not that I've noticed. No, nothing seems to be missing.  


 Tim:
 Well, you dropped £150!


Customer:
 Really! 


 Tim:
 Yes. Now, how can I return your money?  

Customer:
 Oh how refreshingly honest! But I think a small reward is in order, don't you?

 Tim:
Oh I couldn't.

Customer:
 You could. I'm sure you have a pretty young girlfriend who needs to be spoiled.

 Tim:
No I don't. I'm single just now.

 Customer:
A good looking man like you? I don't believe it!
Episode 2:
In the flat


Tim:
Alice this is my cousin Michal - our new flatmate. He's really missing his friends.


Alice:
Oh, Michal let me take your mind off that...So, where are you from?


Michal:
From near Warsaw - the Polish capital.


Alice:
Oh, what do you do? 


Michal:
I'm a guide tourist. 


Alice:
So interesting! Why are you visiting London?


Michal:
To improve my English. 


Alice:
Oh, well, why not come out with us now? Then we can cheer you up and you can practise your English at the same time.
Episode 20: A date by the river  

 Helen:
 Oh Michal, that river cruise was fantastic.


 Michal:
 It was lovely seeing all those famous buildings, wasn't it? 


 Helen:
 Yes, Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye all looked so impressive in the winter light, didn't they? 


 Michal:
 You look lovely in the winter light too you know.  


 Helen:
 Oh Michal, you're so sweet. 


Michal:
 It's true. You're beautiful Helen.

 Helen:
 You're quite a hunk yourself, you know.

Michal:
 That might be true but suddenly I'm feeling a little sea-sick. 

Helen:
 You do look a bit green. You're not going to throw up, are you?
Michal:
 Oh yes, I don't feel well. I think I'm going to be sick.
Helen:
 Was it something I said?
Episode 21: Tim's treat     


 Tim:
 Hiya folks. How's everyone this fine evening?


 Alice:
 Exhausted! I had to give someone mouth-to-mouth for the first time today!


 Helen:
 That's so exciting, congratulations! You must feel really proud.


 Alice:
 Yes I do. How are you Helen?




 Helen:
 I'm  tired, I've been staring at finance textbooks all day.  


Michal:
 I think my head is going to expand from all my studying too.

 Tim:
 Well, how about a drink at the pub? My treat! Would that make you two feel less worn-out? 

Helen:
 You paying for all of us? That's not like you. 

 Alice:
 What's come over you?

Tim:
 Well let's just say I got a special bonus at work.
Episode 22: Christmas lunch


 Alice:
 OK, who's for turkey and all the trimmings? 


 All:
 Me!


 Helen:
 	Let's pull the crackers first! Michal pull one with me. Alice, you pull one with Tim.	




 Tim:
 OK, here goes!  


Helen:
 I won!


 Tim:
 Ah so did I! 

Michal:
 What did you get? 

 Helen:
 A hat, a key-ring and a joke. Are you ready? OK "What do you get if you cross a stereo with a refrigerator?"


All:
 We don't know!


Helen:
 "Cool music!"

Tim:
Ha ha very funny! Right, ready for another one? "What did one dolphin say to the other one?"

All:
 We don't know!
Tim:
 "You did that on porpoise!" 
All:
 Awh! Merry Christmas!
Episode 23: New Year's resolutions   


 Alice:
 Oh it's nearly the New Year. Has everyone got their champagne glasses ready?
	There's still time to think about our New Year's resolutions. Tim, you go first. 
 


 Tim:
 OK, this year I'm going to work really hard and try and get promoted! What about you, cousin Michal? 


 Michal:
 I'm going to give up fast food and be much more healthy. Helen?


 Helen:
 I've got to start really studying. My finals will be here before I know it. Alice?




 Alice:
 My resolution is to find love. I want to meet someone who's gorgeous, funny and rich! Look look, look, it's almost midnight! Let's start counting down: five, four... 


All:
Three, two, one. Cheers, cheers. Happy New Year everyone!

 Tim:
 Marvellous...
Episode 24: The Stockroom 


 Manager:
 Morning Tim, you look very well turned out today. 
 


 Tim:
 	Thank you. It's a new suit for the New Year. I like to look smart for the customers.


 Manager:
 Yes. Erm, I need to talk to you about something. I'd like you to work in the stockroom.


 Tim:
 	The stockroom! But...




 Manager:
 I know, I know. But don't forget the jewellery department will need an assistant manager soon.


Tim:
I don't understand.

 Manager:
 Well, if you do this for me, I'll make sure you get an interview for the position.


Tim:
Right, so if I work in the stockroom...

 Manager:
 You'll have a chance of promotion. No guarantees of course.


Tim:
Hmm.can I think about it?
Episode 25: Fast food


 Alice:
 Ooh, what's that smell? Do I detect cheeseburger and fries? Michal, you disappoint me. What happened to all your resolve at New Year?	
 


 Michal:
I'm trying to give up fast food but it's just so easy and cheap. I'm really beginning to run out of money so I can't afford better food and I'm really missing my mum's cooking and I don't know how to cook the way she does and I miss my friends and I don't have a job.


Alice:
 Oh Michal, don't cry. Come here pet, let me give you a hug. 


 Helen:
 Michal! Alice! What the hell do think you're doing?
Episode 26: Planning a meal


 Michal:
Alice was only helping me!


 Helen:
I'm sorry Michal, I didn't mean to fly off the handle. What's wrong?


Michal:
 I was just telling Alice I wanted to eat better but that I didn't know how to cook any of my favourite dishes. 


 Helen:
 Mm, let's think about this. I know! Chinese New Year is coming up soon. Why don't we make a special Chinese-Polish dinner together! We'll both do research, find typical recipes, buy all the ingredients.



 Michal:
 And cook a meal together! You do the main course, and I'll make the pudding!  



 Helen:
 Sounds like a perfect second date, don't you think?
Episode 27: The hungry cat 


 Tim:
I don't believe it! Kitty's just eaten my dinner. I was putting the kettle on and I turned round and there she was, eating my chicken. That cat's a pain in the neck.


 Alice: Oh calm down. 


Tim:
 	It drives me mad! I'm starving, I've been slaving away in that dusty old stockroom all day. I hate work just now and then this happens! The cat's got to go or be put down.


 Helen:
 Don't be horrible. You can buy something else to eat.



 Tim:
 We're not all as rich as you, you know, daddy's girl!  



 Helen:
 How dare you Tim! I didn't eat your chicken. You drive me up the wall sometimes.

 Alice:
 Hey guys, chill out.
Episode 28: The year of the dog


 Alice:
Happy Chinese New Year Helen! What are you doing?


 Helen:
Reading about our Chinese astrology signs.


Alice:
	Oh do tell.


 Helen:
 Well, I was born in '86 so I'm a tiger. I have an air of authority and am courageous but I'm also prone to emotional outbursts and react poorly under stress. 



 Alice:
Oh, what am I?



 Helen:
 You are 3 years older than me so you're a pig.

 Alice:
 A pig? Charming! 

 Helen:
 No, it's different in Chinese culture. A Chinese pig is magnanimous and 
	highly intelligent. You're a perfectionist but venomous if you're crossed.


 Alice:
 It's all true! What about Michal? 

 Helen:
 Well, he's 21 so he's an ox.  He's dependable, methodical, honest, unbiased but introverted too. 


 Alice:
 Ooh, so does that bode well for you two or not?
Episode 29: A secret admirer


 Helen:
 It's Valentine's Day. There's a card for you Alice. Who is it from?


Alice:
	Give me a minute. Let me read it first...It says:       
	               "Oh Nurse Alice. You're the queen of my palace.  
	I don't know if you care for me. But I must tell my feelings free.  
	Who knows what's in store. Do you find me an awful bore?  
	Are we really poles apart? Or could you nurse me and my heart?  
	Your CPR breathes life anew. May mine fill you with passion true?"  
	Oh, isn't that romantic?



 Helen:
Yes, but who's it from?



 Alice:
It's a valentine, there's no signature. 



 Helen:
But who do you think it's from? There are quite a few clues in the card.
Episode 3:
At the pub 


Tim:
It's your round Alice


Alice:
What, again? Alright, what do you all want?


Helen:
An orange juice please. 


Michal:
The same for me too.


Tim:
	Oh come on Michal, you're not in Poland now. Why not try a traditional pint of English bitter?


Michal:
OK then.

Tim:And the usual for me - a G & T, love
Alice:Em, OK.
Helen:Don't call Alice "love".


Tim:
Why not, isn't she lovely? Michal, what do you think?
Episode 30: Career decisions


 Tim:
 Hi Alice, what are you reading?


Alice:
 Oh. It's about maternity and baby care. They've asked me to change wards.


Tim:
But you love working in the emergency wards.



 Alice:
Yes, well.I want to work with Dr. Laver. 



Tim:
Dr. Laver? 



 Alice:
	He specialises in looking after children. He's a great doctor, really friendly with the patients.
 



Tim:
I see. And he's not bad looking, I suppose? 



 Alice:
Don't be ridiculous! I'm thinking about my career. 



Tim:
	But you want your own children. Don't you think it'd be horrible looking after other people's kids?	



 Alice:
Yeah, that's the problem. So I haven't decided whether to take the job or not.
Episode 31: The photocopier  


 John:
 Hey, Helen, look what I've found on the photocopier - the answers for next week's test! 


Helen:
 The answers? You'd better hand them in to the office.


 John:
You're kidding, aren't you? I think you should wise up. 


 Helen:
 What do you mean? 


 John:
We've both been struggling with the work this term; here's our chance to pass with flying colours. If I were you, I 'd make the most of it. 

 Helen:
 What? Cheat? We can't do that!


 John:
 Why not? Do you want to fail? Your parents won't like it if you do. 


 Helen:
 No, I don't want to fail. But, if we get caught. 


 John:
 We won't get caught. Come on, what do you say?


 Helen:
 Well, I'm not sure..
Episode 32: Baby talk


Dr. Laver:
 Okay, well in this room we monitor the babies overnight. Now, the important thing is to talk to them.


Alice:
 Talk to them? What do I say?


Dr. Laver:
Well, watch me. Hello, you are a handsome boy aren't you? You're gorgeous.
	Now you try. Speak to the baby next to you.


 Alice:
Oh, okay. Hello little one! Who's a handsome boy then?


Dr. Laver:
Erm, that's a girl.


Alice:
Oh! Who's a pretty little girl? What a lovely smile! Aren't you lovely?  Oh, oh, oh! 


Dr. Laver:
Excellent, excellent - you're a natural. You'll make a very good nurse here and a lovely mother one day I'm sure.
Episode 33: The dripping tap


Michal:
 Hey Tim, what are you doing?


Tim:
I'm fixing this tap. I can't put up with that drip-drip noise anymore.


Michal:
Have you turned off the water?


 Tim:
	I told you. That's what I'm working on.


Michal:
I mean the main water supply? Have you cut it off?


Tim:
No, I haven't. Stop worrying and let me get on with this. 


Michal:
I don't think you should carry on doing that!

Tim:
It's okay, just one more turn of the spanner. 


Michal:
I really think you should stop.

Tim:
Oh, go away Michal. You're putting me off. One more turn and
	then ... aaaaaargh! Oh no! Michal! Help! Stop the water! Aaaaaargh!
Episode 34: Helen to the rescue


Michal:
I told you so!


Tim:
	Hurry up, I'm getting soaked!


Helen:
What's going on here? What a mess! Dad'll kill me.


Michal:
It's the water. Tim didn't turn off it before trying to fix the tap.


 Helen:
	Honestly Tim! You're as thick as two short planks sometimes. Michal, turn the water off. Tim, give me the spanner. I'll soon have
this sorted.



Tim:
What shall I do?


Helen:
Get the mop, of course! I want this floor as dry as a bone now! Dad's coming round later to check the flat.
 


Tim:
Is he? 


Tim and Michal:
Oh no!
 
Helen:
No, I'm just winding you up!

Episode 36: Test results


John:
How did you do in the economics test Helen? 


Helen:
I failed miserably.


John:
Oh poor you! I got 98%. Didn't want to get a perfect score. Might have looked a bit suspicious, given me recent track record. Bet you wished you'd sneaked a peek at the answers when you had your chance.


 Helen:
Oh I don't ...



John:
You're a fool! It was the easiest bit of photocopying I've ever done.


Prof. Lewis:
John, Helen hello!
 


John:
Oh good morning Professor Lewis. I was just saying how much I've 	been enjoying your lectures recently. 


Prof. Lewis:
Oh really? Helen, I think it's about time we had a little chat, don't you? Come to my office later and make an appointment, OK?
Episode 37: The interview


Interviewer:
How long have you been working at McCarthy's?


Tim:
For the last 3 years. 


Interviewer:
And have you always worked in retail?


Tim:
Yes I have. In fact ever since I was young I've been interested in 	commerce. My first job was in a newsagent's when I was still at school.


 Interviewer:
	I see, and what are your strengths and weaknesses?


Tim:
Well, some might say I'm a little head-strong. I do leap into projects and sometimes my enthusiasm can be a bit overwhelming. My strengths? I'm a great team-player. For example, when the stockroom was understaffed recently, I jumped at the chance to help out. 


Interviewer:
Lovely. Well thank you for coming in today. We'll be in touch very soon.
Episode 38: A chat with the professor


Prof. Lewis:
Come in Helen, sit down. Now how are you?


Helen:
Fine really. Honestly, I'm fine.


Prof. Lewis:
Are you? That's not what your marks are saying to me. They tell a very 	different story. You failed this mid-term test quite badly. Even John, who seems to do no work at all in class, managed to do so much better than you.


 Helen:
Humph!


Prof. Lewis:
Is there something you want to talk about?


Helen:
No, it's nothing.
 


Prof. Lewis:
You and John just don't seem as close as you used to be. Is there something wrong? 


Helen:
No, it's just that..Oh I don't know.
 
Prof. Lewis:
Helen, I'm here to help. Now why don't you just tell me what's on your mind.
Episode 39: A friend of a friend


Helen:
Well, you see, I have this friend. And, she has a problem. She saw a friend of hers doing something wrong and now she doesn't know what to do. If she reports him, he'll know it was her and probably won't ever speak to her again. But if she doesn't report him, he'll just get away with it. 


Prof. Lewis:
What do you think your 'friend' should do?


 Helen:
 I haven't got a clue!


Prof. Lewis:
Well, you can tell your 'friend' that I'm extremely suspicious about someone's unusually high test score recently and I also overheard some very worrying comments about photocopying being 'very easy'.


Helen:
Really?  


Prof. Lewis:
Yes really. Now what's your friend of a friend's name?


Helen:
It's .it's John.
Episode 4 :
Another round


Michal:She's beautiful.


Alice:What's wrong with you?


Helen: Nothing! You know I think Michal really likes you.


Alice: Don't be daft! He's only being polite.


Helen: Do you think so?


Alice: Yes, and why are you so interested all of a sudden?

Helen:
No, no reason really. Look, I've got to get back to the flat, I've got loads of studying to do.

Alice:Oh relax! The books can wait. Tim's buying the next round. What do you want?
Episode 40: Right or wrong?


Michal:
You did what?


Helen:
I had to Michal. I had no choice.


Michal:
Haven't you got any morals? You know that you're supposed to stick to your friends.


Helen:
How could I? He cheated. The professor knew. She had me over a barrel.


 Michal:
How you say in English? 'A friend in need is a friend indeed'? You didn't turn out to be a very good friend, did you?


Helen:
Listen Michal ...


Michal:
No, you listen for a change. You're selfish and two-faced Helen. It makes me worry about what you're saying about me behind my back. Now, leave me alone. I don't ever want to speak to you again!  
 


Helen:
Oh no Michal!
Episode 41: Tickets for lunch


Tim:
Yeah and just tidy up that display now. Oh good morning madam.


Customer:
Hello. It's nice to see you on this side of the counter for a change.


Tim:
Yes, I've been promoted. I'm an Assistant Manager now!


Customer:
Oh does your ambition know no bounds? Congratulations!


 Tim:
Thank you. Now how can I help you today?


Customer:
It's more about how I can help you. I've got the option of some World Cup tickets and, quelle suprise, football bores me silly. Would you care for them? 


Tim:
I'd love them! But I could never afford them.
 


Customer:
Well, that's where you're wrong. Just keep a gal company over lunch some time soon and they're yours for nothing...
Episode 42: A raffle


Tim:
We're on our way to Deutschland, Deutschland!


Helen:
	Tim, what's got into you?


 Tim:	
The promise of two gorgeous, free world cup tickets, that's what! 


Alice:	
That's fantastic. Can I go with you, please? 
  
Tim:
No, it's a boy thing - Michal, ready for action?


Helen:
Well that's just typical! You're such a sexist, old-fashioned bore Tim. What makes you think Alice and I don't want to see the match?


Tim:
Oh-oh. OK, anything to keep the peace. Sorry Michal.


Michal:
Don't worry. Helen, how should we decide who goes with Tim?


Helen:
Oh stop trying to get on my good side - it's not working. 


Tim:
Well?


Helen:
There's only one fair way - a raffle.


Tim:
OK everyone's name in the hat then.
Episode 43: Exam revision* 




 Michal:
 Oh dear I have my exam today. I'm really worried. Helen, will you practise with me please? 


 Helen:
 You must be joking! 


Michal:
 Alice?


 Alice:
Oh Michal, you know I'm just back from a night-shift. I'm exhausted, sorry. 


Tim:
 Don't worry mate, you'll be all right. Just relax, be yourself.

Michal:
 But I did very bad in my practice test last week. 


Helen:
I told you Michal, it's important to revise for exams but you went out every night this week.

Michal:
 Yes I know but it's a speaking exam so I had to talk to people. Won't anyone help me? Thanks Bronka, that's a big help!

Episode 44: A free lunch




 Tim:
 That food was delicious!

 It took ages to come but yes, absolutely scrummy. Ready for afters?  


Tim:
 Thank you.


 Mrs Hall:
Go on, open it.


Tim:
World Cup tickets! How can I ever thank you Mrs Hall?

Mrs Hall:
 Well you can start by dropping the formality. Please, call me Janet.


Tim:
Alright ... Janet.

Mrs Hall:
 Much better. Now, my husband's away on business next month. So we'll do lunch again then.  


Tim:
Your husband?

Mrs Hall:
 Well where did you think those corporate tickets came from? Yes, he's good for some things but quite dreadful for others - like decent lunch company. 


Tim:
I'm not sure if I'm free. Let me check the rota first.
Episode 45: Packing 


Tim:
Hurry up Alice! 


 Alice:
I'm going as fast as I can.


Tim:
 The plane's going to take off without us at this rate. You've not even finished packing yet! 

Alice:
 Don't hassle me! I couldn't just walk out in the middle of an emergency. I'm a nurse. These things happen. I got here as fast as I could.  


Tim:
Look, have you got the most important things? 

Alice:
 Tickets, money, passport - yes they're all here. 


Tim:
OK, grab what you've got and let's go.

Alice:
 Oh Tim, hang on! Have you got the football tickets?  

Tim:
Yes! They're right here... Where are they?

Alice:
 Just relax. When did you last see them?

Tim:
Yesterday, today, oh, I don't know. Where are they?
Episode 46: A day at the beach


Michal:
I'm so glad we decided to come to Brighton! 


Helen:
Yeah, so much better than going to the poxy World Cup in Germany. 


 Michal:
 Let's sit here on the beach. What a perfect spot for an ice-cream!



Helen:
Oh, look at that guy over there. He looks nice ...tall and handsome.
	


 Michal:
 Ahem, I thought you were here with me!



Man:
 Excuse me. 


Helen:
Oh, hello can we help you?


Man:
I wonder if you could tell me where Brighton Pier is? 
	


Michal:
 It's right over there! 


Man:
Oh, course it is, silly me. Thanks, bye. 


Michal: 
 Helen, how about that ice cream now? 


Helen:
Oh no! I can't find my purse!

	


Michal: 
 It must have been that man! 


Helen:
Oi you! Stop!
	


Michal:
I'll get him!
Episode 47: A call from Germany


Helen:
Hello?


Alice:
Guten morgen! Hi Helen, it's Alice.
	


Helen:
Hey, how are you? What's Germany like? Are you having fun?
	


 Alice:
 I'm fine, it's fab and yes, yes, yes! How are things back home?



Helen:
 Great. We've just come back from Brighton and Michal was a complete star!


Alice:
Oh how so?

Helen:
 Well this guy stole my purse while we were on the beach and he ran 	after him like a bat out of hell, caught him and got my purse back! He was 	a real hero! 

Alice:
Oh quite the Superman, I'm sure! So have you made up with him then? 


Helen: 
 What do you think? Of course ... Oh, her money must have run out.
Episode 48: Strawberries and cream


John:
Oh Helen! Fancy bumping into you at Wimbledon! 
	


Helen:
 And I was having such a nice time too.


John:
Bet you're here on one of those cheap afternoon tickets, aren't you?

Helen:
 Yeah but for a fiver they're such a bargain. 

John:
I wouldn't know. I've been here all day - in the Centre Court posh seats - not much change from fifty quid. Well, I won't keep you. I need to get on with my horrendously expensive strawberries and cream before they get warm.


Helen: 
 Oh, look out!
	


John:
Arrghh! I'm covered in strawberries and cream!

Man:
 I'm so sorry, I wasn't looking where I was going. 
Helen:
 Look on the bright side John. At least with all that red and white, you look ...
Episode 49: The quarter-finals


Tim:
England are out! We lost on penalties again!
	


Alice:
 I'm gutted! I blame Rooney. 


Tim:
He didn't do nuffink!

Alice:
 How can you say that? We all saw what he did. The ref had to send him off.  

Tim:
I still say we was robbed. The ref was far too free and easy with that card.


Alice: 
 You're just looking for a scapegoat.
	


Tim:
No I'm not.

Alice:
 What about the manager, the skipper, the strikers? Don't you blame them? 
Tim:
 	Don't be so rational Alice. We're going back empty-handed and I can't stand it! 
Alice:
 Oh cheer up Tim. We'll be home soon and you and Michal can commiserate with each other - England and Poland out of the World Cup again ... until next time!
Episode 5:
Helen at home


Helen:Hello?




Mum: Hello? Helen? It's mum here. How are you my dear? Studying hard? You know how much your degree means to your father and me.


Helen:
	I was studying before you phoned me! Listen, I need your advice. I'm in love! But he doesn't even notice me. He only has eyes for Alice. What can I do?


Mum:
Love? Love! There's plenty of time for that later. Get your head out of the clouds and back into your books. Do you hear me?


Helen:
Yes, yes mum.

I'm not phoning anyone I just want to see if I've got any messages.
Episode 51: Summertime blues


Alice:
It's nice to be back but I do miss the excitement of the World Cup. I'm bored!
	


Helen:
 Oh thanks very much!


Alice:
I didn't mean you! I just mean it's a bit hard to come back to reality that's all. 

Tim:
Who says we have to? Why don't we do something to cheer ourselves up? 

Alice:
Like what?


Michal: 
 Go to the pub.	


Alice:
No, it's too smoky.

Tim:
 Go to a nightclub. 
Helen:
It's too noisy. 
Michal:
 How about going to the cinema?

Alice: 
 There's nothing on I really want to see.	


Michal:
We could have a party.

Alice:
 What are we celebrating? 
Michal:
You know it's almost a year since I came to live here. 
Tim:
 Perfect! We'll have our first anniversary party!
Episode 52: The BBQ


Michal:
Hi,  come on in and have a drink.
	We're just firing up the barbecue. 
 


	



	Khalid:
 Oh, it's nice to see you outside the classroom my friend. Thanks for inviting me. 


Helen:
Oh it's lovely to meet you Khalid. Michal's told us all about you.


	Tim:
 So, who's for the best grub over hot coals this summer? 

All:
Me! Yes please! Wonderful! 


	Alice:
 Drinks anyone? Can I get you a top-up Dr Laver?

Dr Laver:
Oh come on. We've been working together for how long, looked after how many babies? I'm here at your party. Please, my name's Paul. And how about a dance before that drink?


Alice:
Oh, OK!


	John:
Great party! Thanks so much for asking me. 

Helen:
Maybe it is time for us to patch it up. But I didn't invite you. 


	John:
 Well, here's a toast to the secret peace-maker.

Helen:
I'll drink to that!
Episode 53: The morning after


Michal:
Morning everyone. What a great barbeque yesterday! Coffee and biscuits Alice? 
 


	


Alice:
 Oh no, I feel dreadful. I was throwing up all night long! 


Tim:
One too many cocktails?

	Alice:
 No! I hardly touched a drop. One minute I was having a ball ... 

Helen:
Getting chatted up more like! 

	Alice:
 Yeah, I saw a completely different side to Paul. 

Michal:
Who?


Alice:
Doctor Laver.

	All:
Oooh!

Alice:
Oh don't! Give me a break!

Tim:
 So, was it the good doctor who made you ill?

Alice:
No, it must've been something I ate.

	Helen:
But we all ate the same things.

Michal:
It looked gorgeous, but I didn't have any of the salmon. Did you?

Helen:
 No.

Tim:
No.


Alice:
Yes....oh, no!
Episode 54: A mother daughter chat


Michal:
Helen, this place is enormous! 
 	


Helen:
It's just a house, don't get so overexcited by it. And promise me you won't treat me differently after this visit.


Mum:
Hello! Just drop your bags anywhere dears. Michal, will you get daddy in from the garden? Then we'll all have a nice cup of Chinese tea together.


Michal:
Of course.

Mum:
Oh Helen, he's adorable! I know I said you were too young for love but that was ages ago and it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind.

Helen:
Mum, I think he's the one!

Mum:
 Oh me too, I watched you two coming up the path and I saw how you looked at him. Do I hear wedding bells?

Helen:
Don't say that, you'll jinx us!
Episode 55: Fatherly advice


Michal:
Hello, I've been sent to take you.  
 	


Dad:
I can't get a minute's peace around here! 


Michal:
No wonders you love it here, your garden's beautiful.

Dad:
Thank you Michal. Just my luck though, neither Helen nor her mother has green fingers. 

Michal:
I love gardening!

Dad:
 I knew I liked you for a reason! Helen's head is filled with love and romance but I am more of a realist. I've built up my business and my garden the same way - years of hard graft. Helen's looking for a handsome husband but I want a hard-working son-in-law. Of course it will be a slog but the rewards are right here for you to see. 

Michal:
Eh, yeah, it must be time for tea! Let's talk later.
Episode 56: At the doctor's


Dr. Kelly:
So, what's the matter?  
 	


Alice:
Well, I've been feeling ill ever since a barbecue a few days ago. My
stomach's still upset, and I feel dizzy.
 


Dr. Kelly:
I see. Any other symptoms?

Alice:
Erm, I've got a bit of a temperature.

Dr Kelly:
Well, it isn't anything serious, probably just food poisoning... Excuse me. Come in.

Dr. Laver:
 Sorry to disturb, just returning these notes. Alice!

Alice:
Dr. Laver!


Dr. Laver:
You look very pale. Look, can I give you a lift home, when you've finished?

Alice:
That would be lovely.

Dr. Laver:
Okay, I'll see you outside. 
	Sorry about the interruption, Dr. Kelly.


Dr. Kelly:
 Not at all. Thanks for the notes. Bye... Are you okay Alice?
Episode 57: Dr Laver takes the plunge


Dr. Laver:
I had a lovely time at the barbecue, although I drank too much wine. I had a terrible hangover.
 	


Alice:
Did you? I just wish I hadn't had that salmon, especially as I'd already had
enough food. I was just being greedy.



Dr. Laver:
Oh well, not to worry, you'll be alright soon. In fact, I was wondering, erm...


Alice:
Yes, yes?

Dr. Laver:
Well, when you're well enough, would you like to go out one evening?

Alice:
Are you asking me out on a date, Dr. Laver?

Dr. Laver:
Well yes, I... I guess I am, and please, call me Paul.


Alice:
Well, Paul, I'd love to go on a date.


Dr. Laver:
Great. Would Friday be too soon?
Episode 58: A complaint


Tim:
How can I help you sir? 
 	


Customer:
It's about this watch.



Tim:
What seems to be the problem?


Customer:
The alarm doesn't work and the strap leaves a green mark on my wrist when I take it off. 
Tim:
Have you worn the watch in the shower perhaps sir?

Customer:
No and I only bought it two weeks ago. It's still under guarantee but I must say, for the amount of money I paid for it, I'm very disappointed.  

Tim:
I'm so sorry you've been inconvenienced. Would you like a refund?


Customer:
No, I'd rather have the watch replaced please. 


Tim:
Right, well, I'll just take down your purchasing details and we'll get this watch changed for you in no time at all.
Episode 59: Tim's love advice


Michal:
Tim, can I talk to you? 



Tim:
Sure, what's on your mind?


Michal:
It's about Helen and her family. 
Tim:
Yeah, how was that visit you had to her folks' place? 

Michal:
It was difficult. 

Tim:
Why?


Michal:
Well, I thought Helen and I were just having some fun, you know, nothing too serious. But her parents have already got us married and are right now thinking up names for the grandchildren we're going to give them! 


Tim:
Does Helen feel the same as you then?


Michal:
I'm not sure. 

Tim:
Well, you need to find out and then you've got to set her parents straight ...
I wonder who that is.
Episode 6:
Breakfast time


Tim:
Morning, campers!




Alice:
Ooh, not so loud, my head's killing me.


Michal:
I'm feel awful too. I've got a pain stomach. My head hurts.....


Tim: Welcome to your first British hangover Michal! What you need now is a good fry-up.


Alice:
Bleugh! Oh, morning Helen. You look as bad as I feel. Have you been crying?


Helen:
No, no of course not. Just burning the midnight oil studying, studying, studying.


Tim:
So, who's for eggs, beans and toast?


Alice:
Urgh! You really are a pain in the neck sometimes Tim!
Episode 60: Bad news


Michal:
What if it's her? 



Tim:
You've got to talk to her.


Michal:
Hello?  
Dad:
Michal? It's dad. 

Michal:
Oh dzien dobry tatus. 

Dad:
No, no, no you're in England, let's talk English. It's good for both of us to practise. 


Michal:
OK. So, how are you? 


Dad:
Not great.


Michal:
What's wrong?

Dad:
Oh, it's, it's my heart, nothing serious. Just a little heart attack. But 
	you know ...

Michal:
A little heart attack? There's no such thing!

Dad:
Calm down! The doctor said it's time for me to look after myself more, time to stop working so hard, time to get some help around here. Em, em Michal I hate to ask you but ...

Michal:
Dad, you know you can count on me.
Episode 61: A difficult conversation


Helen:
Hi Michal, what are you doing on the computer? Let's see. One ticket to Poland! Michal, what's going on? 


Michal:
Helen, we have to talk about everything! We need to talk about love, commitment, family and about dads.
Helen:
Dad? What did he say to you in the garden? You've been acting all funny since we got back from that visit. 

Michal:
No, Helen not your dad, my dad. He's had a heart attack. 

Helen:
Oh, that's awful. So that's why you are flying over to visit him. How long are you going for?


Michal:
Helen, it's a one-way ticket I've booked; I'm going back to Poland for good.
Episode 62: A dream date


Alice:
This is a lovely restaurant Paul. 


Paul:
Yes, it's one of my favourites. Would you like dessert?
Alice:
Well... the chocolate cake looks very tempting. 

Paul:
Then you must try some. And we must do this again. I've really enjoyed your company today. Alice, would you be able to join me for dinner next Saturday?

Alice:
Oh Paul, I'd love to, but I have to work a night shift next weekend. Maybe we could come here again for lunch later in the week?


Paul:
We could do that, but I know another place that I think you'd like better.
Episode 63: A sad goodbye


Tim:
 Well cousin Michal, this is goodbye.



Alice:
 You've been a great friend to us all and a great flatmate too. 


Michal:
Thanks you guys.  


Tim:
Bye Michal and give my love to Uncle Kazimierz. 


Michal:
Yeah, I will. 

Tim:
 Alice, I think we should leave these two alone. 


Helen:
Oh Michal, it seems like only yesterday I was here in the airport to meet you and now you're leaving me.  


Michal:
 Helen, I've got something to tell you. I really like you but I'm not ready to settle down. I'm going back to Poland to look after my dad but also because I need some space. Do you hate me now? 

Helen:
 Of course not! You'll always have a place in my heart. 
Michal:
 That's my flight. Goodbye Helen.  


Helen:
Goodbye my love.
Episode 64: A strange letter


Alice:
 Hi Tim. What are you reading, or is it private?



Tim:
Oh, nothing. 


Alice:
Sure it's not a love letter?  


Tim:
I'm sure! In fact, it's a bit strange. Remember I had to return that customer's watch? 


Alice:
 Mmmm? 

Tim:
 Well, listen to their reply. 'As the watch you have returned is not genuine, we are unable to repair it. Also, this is the fourth time that this has happened and consequently we can not accept further watches from you.' 


Alice:
Weird! You told your boss?  


Tim:
 Well, I should, but I'm a bit curious about this. My boss is the only other person who sells the watches. As well as that, he might blame me.

Alice:
 I see what you mean. Hmm. But despite that, I still think you should tell him.
Episode 65: A tricky meeting


Boss:
 Come in. Ah, Tim, how can I help? 



Tim:
 Erm, well, I think you should read this letter from the watch repairers. 


Boss:
	Oh yes, let me see it. hmm, well, I imagine someone in their office must have made a mistake.  


Tim:
Perhaps, but this isn't the first time this has happened. 


Boss:
Well, do you think you might have made a mistake when you took the watch from the customer? 

Tim:
 I don't think so. 


Boss:
But you're not certain? You could've made a mistake, couldn't you?  


Tim:
 Well, I always check the paperwork.

Boss:
 Well, let's not worry about it now, but in future, I'll deal with customer complaints. And try to be more careful in future, okay?
Episode 66: Choosing a gift


Janet:
 And how's my favourite shop assistant today? 



Tim:
	Oh! Good morning, Janet! It's assistant manager actually.


Janet:
So sorry, darling, assistant manager. Now, I do hope you can help me. I'm looking for a very special gift for a very special person. 


Tim:
I'm sure we can help you there madam. Is it for a gentleman or a lady? 

Janet:
 	A gentleman. Fine jewellery looks so lovely on a man, don't you agree?  


Tim:
	In that case, let me show you these cuff-links and here are some very nice tie-clips.  


Janet:
 Those watches look rather nice.

Tim:
 Err, yes. but the latest model isn't available, and it's important to have the latest model, don't you think? 
Janet:
 Not necessarily. I always say that style is more important than fashion.
Episode 67: A call from Poland


Tim:
 Hey Helen, guess who just called? 



Helen:
Oh no, was it Michal?


Tim:
Yes, you just missed him!  



Helen:
 	Oh, no! 


Tim:
	He said to send you his love.  Why don't you call him back?    


Helen:
 	No. He said he needed some space, so I've got to give him some space. But I wish I'd been here when he called. What else did he say?

Tim:
 Oh, he sounded well, he's working hard, his dad's a bit better, nothing much really.
Helen:
I really miss him. 
Tim:
You need to get out and about you know. 
Helen:
 I suppose so. Shall we all go and see a movie tonight? 
Tim:
 	I'd be up for it, but I think Alice has gone out with Paul, to some sort of art exhibition, I think. 
Helen:
 Again? That's interesting. I think those two might be getting serious.
Episode 68: Is the cat ill?


Helen:
 Hey guys, do you think the cat's okay?



Alice:
 The cat? Seems fine to me. Why? 


Helen:
	I think we should take her to the vet. She doesn't seem right.  


Alice:
She's fine. 


Helen:
No, she's not! You guys never listen to me. 	Tim, can you take her to the vet? 

Tim:
 I'm sorry Helen. I'm up to my ears in work at the moment. Anyway, she
		seems fine, aren't you Kitty?
 


Helen:
I told you she's not well! Right, if you lot don't care, I'll take her!  


Tim:
Blimey, what's up with her?

Alice:
 Oh, she's just a bit down in the dumps at the moment. 
Tim:
 Right. Why's that? 
Alice:
 Tim! You're such a bloke, aren't you?
Episode 69: The art gallery 


Alice:
 This is a lovely painting.  



Paul:
Isn't it? Let's find out about it. Excuse me!


Guide:
Ooh, hello there, can I help you?  



Alice:
 	Could you tell us a little about this one please? 


Guide:
Ooh, by all means. this beautiful picture is several hundred years old. In this period, paintings would often be commissioned by the wealthy as a way of showing their status, and, they would be hung in the home to be admired by visitors, in much the same way that we might admire an expensive piece of jewellery or a car these days.    


Alice:
  Oh, it's beautiful. How long would it have taken to paint?

Guide:
 Well, a painting like this would probably have taken up to a year to complete.
Paul:
Mmm, it's a fine piece: one of my favourites.
Episode 7:
Paying the rent
Helen:Oh no, it's that time of the month again - time to pay the rent. 
 Tim: Comes round fast enough, doesn't it? 
 Alice:
Yeah and I'm so broke just now. I don't know where my money goes. 

 Tim: You need to tighten your belt Alice. Well, I'm fairly flush this month, want me to lend 	you some cash? 
 Alice: Tim, would you? 
 Tim: 	Sure, you know me, always willing to help a damsel in distress. There's only one small catch......
Episode 70: Heartbreak for Alice? 


Alice's mum:
 Alice, you sound dreadful - what's the matter?  



Alice:
Oh nothing Mum.


Alice's mum:
Doesn't sound like nothing to me Alice.    



Alice:
 Mum, you can't do anything to help.




Alice's mum:
Maybe not Alice, but you might feel better if you talk about it.    


Alice:
  Ok, well, I had a date with Paul last night, and when I arrived at the restaurant, he was talking to somebody on the phone, 
	but he didn't see me come in, and I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I heard what he was saying, and I heard him say something like, 'I can't wait to see you' and he said, 'darling'  and then I heard him say, 'I love you'!

Alice's mum:
 	Oh Alice, there's probably a perfectly reasonable explanation.
Alice:
He's seeing someone else Mum, that's the explanation!
Episode 71: Paul confesses


Alice:
 Look Paul, we've been seeing each other for quite a while, and I think we've been getting on well together...


Paul:
I think so too!


Alice:
Paul, there's something I want to ask you, and even though I'm afraid of the answer, I really need to know the truth. Paul, are you seeing anybody else?    



Paul:
 No! Alice, there's no-one else, at least not in the way you think.




Alice:
	Not in the way I think? What does that mean? Just tell me Paul, what's going on?    


Paul:
  Alice, I've been trying to tell you this for weeks now, but I've been afraid of your reaction. The truth is. the truth is that I was married for several years, but my wife left me eighteen months ago.
Episode 72: Christmas 
                            shopping


Alice:

 Hmm, what do you think, you two, how do I look?



Helen:

Ooh, it's a gorgeous dress, Alice, but the other 
                              one seemed nicer.


Alice:

 Mmm, it is lovely, isn't it? But you're right, 
                              the blue dress looks better. Tim?



Tim:

 Oh yes, lovely, very nice. Can we go and look 
                              at the computer games now?



Alice:

 Ok Tim, you've been very patient. Let's just get 
                              Helen's shoes and then we can go to the electronics 
                              shop. I want to buy a camera for my brother, and 
                              then Helen wants to get a book for her Dad, don't 
                              you Helen?


Helen:

Yes, and after that I expect we'll all be feeling peckish, 
                              so we'll have a quick bite to eat, and then Alice 
                              wants to look at winter coats.



Tim:

Here we go



Alice:

It won't take as long as the dress, I promise!
Episode 73: Holiday 
                            plans 


Helen:

 So what are we all doing at Christmas? Tim, you've 
                              got a few days off work, haven't you?



Tim:

Indeed I have Helen, and I'm popping over to Poland 
                              for a few days. I'm looking forward to a nice cosy 
                              Christmas. Fancy joining me?


Helen:

 I've already been invited, thank you very much. 
                              Michal and I had quite a long chinwag the other 
                              day. It'd be nice to see him but I've already made 
                              plans. I'm spending Christmas and New Year with 
                              my Mum and Dad, and Alice, it would be really nice if 
                              you could join us.



Alice:

 Thanks Helen, I'd love to. But you know I'm working 
                              over the New Year, so I'll have to come back before 
                              you do.



Tim:

 Yeah, but at least you won't be on your own for 
                              the main event.
Episode 74: Alone at New Year
                           


Alice:
Ah Kitty, there never was anything wrong with you, was there? I told Helen you were ok, but she wouldn't listen. She had to listen to the vet though. He said you were the healthiest cat he'd ever seen. Anyway Kitty, Happy New Year: it's just you and me tonight. I didn't plan it this way Kitty, do you remember? I made all those resolutions last year: I was going to meet a gorgeous man. He was going to be funny, and rich too. And I did meet him, Kitty, we were going to get married and everything, ok, he hadn't asked me yet, but I had high hopes. But I didn't know he had a skeleton in his closet: a wife and two children. Oh well Kitty, that's that eh? 

                            Ooh Kitty, who could that be? It's very late.
Episode 75: Paul's explanation
                           


Alice:
Hello?




Paul:
 Alice, it's Paul. Don't hang up, Alice. Just give me two minutes of your time, that's all I ask. 




Alice:
 Ok Paul, but we haven't got much to talk about. You're married with two kids, end of story. 




Paul:
 Alice, it's over between Lucy and me. It's been over for a long time. 




Alice:
	Paul, I heard you talking to her on the phone.  You were telling her you loved her. 




Paul:
No, Alice, you've got it all wrong.  I was talking to my daughter, not my wife.  I used to love my wife, of course, but that ended very abruptly when I came home from work, and she calmly announced that she had fallen in love with someone else.  So that was it, finished.  I moved out the same day.




Alice:
 Oh Paul. 




Paul:
 Alice, it's you I love.
Episode 76: A new flatmate?
                           


Helen:
Ok everyone, I've got an announcement. We need to get someone for Michal's room as soon as possible.




Alice/Tim:
 Really?




Helen:
 Yeah well, he e-mailed me the other day and he seems to be staying in Poland, at least for the time being. 
	And my dad's starting to get twitchy about the rent. He doesn't want the room sitting empty much longer.





Tim:
 Fair enough, I suppose. So, have you got anyone in mind? 




Helen:
	Well we could advertise for someone. 




Alice:
I've got a colleague who's looking for a room! 




Helen:
Have you?




Alice:
 Yeah, she's got to move out of her flat by the end of the month.



Tim:
 Oh no. We're having another guy, thank you very much...



Helen:
 So let's get an advert in the paper, straight away!
Episode 77: Writing an advert
                           


Alice:
Right, how does this sound?  Wanted: student or young professional...




Tim:
... male student or young professional.




Alice:
Ok. From the top. Wanted: male student or young professional for bright, sunny room in flatshare. 





Tim:
... in mixed flatshare ... 
 


Alice:
... for bright, sunny room in mixed flatshare. Must be clean, tidy and easy-going. Close to shops, pubs and buses. Reasonable rent.   




Helen:
Shouldn't we say something about the cat? He might be allergic.




Alice:
Ooh, yeah, good point.  Must be clean, tidy, easy-going and must like cats.  Ooh, and shall we say something about, you know, the dishwasher, tv, broadband.




Helen:
Yeah, put 'all mod cons'.



Alice:
 Ok, mixed flatshare with all mod cons.  Shall I read it back to you?



Tim:
 Yeah, and then call the small ads department at the Gazette. Or we could go with the Courier.
Episode 78: Not much luck
                           


Helen:
	...no, no, that's ok, thanks for calling... I hope you'll find somewhere soon - bye!




Tim:
Was that another call about the room?
                            
                            



Helen:
Yeah, but he works right over the other end of town. He said the commute would be too much. 





Alice:
Mmm, the last one said that too, didn't he? 
                           
                           


Helen:
I know.  We're not having much luck here. 




Tim:
What about the guy who came round yesterday?




Helen/Alice:
No!!!




Helen:
 Eeeww, he was really creepy. 



Alice:
 I know... the one before that was alright though... clean-cut.



Helen:
 He was very respectable, but a bit posh, I thought... 




Tim:
 So, what happened to him then?




Helen:
 He said it was too expensive. Do you think we should put the advert in the paper for another week?
Episode 79: Stop moping! 



Helen:
 Hey guys.	




Alice:
Hey Helen! 



Tim:
Hey Helen, good day?




Helen:
Not really... 


Tim:
 Look Helen, I'm going to call a spade a spade. Michal isn't coming back and you've got to stop moping around. You can't spend all day sitting by yourself watching telly. It's a new year, and it's time to pull yourself together and start living your life again . 
							



Alice:
 He's right, Helen - you need to turn over a new leaf and start enjoying yourself again.
                            



Helen:
 I suppose you might be right. I have got into a bit of a rut lately.													
						  



Alice:
 A bit! You haven't been out for weeks! Come on Helen, it'll do you good to let your hair down. It'll do me good too. Let's go out and have some fun.




Tim:
Yeah, let's do that.
    					  


Helen:
 What, now?




Alice:
 Yes, now! Come on Helen, get your act together and let's go!
Episode 8:
The newcomer


Alice:
Hi Michal! Look what I found in a box, near the rubbish bins outside the hospital. Can you believe someone wanted to throw her away! Isn't she adorable?


Michal:
What are you going to call her? How about Bronka? That's a good Polish name.


Alice:
Mm, I think she looks more like a Co-Co...Oh, hi Helen, meet our new flatmate. We just need to find a name for her.	


Helen:
Em, I don't think so. You know we're not allowed pets in the flat. It's against the rules.
Episode 80: Skating on thin ice 



Alice:
Are you enjoying yourself, Helen?	




Helen:
Do you know what? I'm having a really good time. Thanks for dragging me out, guys.



Tim:
It's just nice to see you smiling, Helen.




Helen:
Hey, is that Paul over there?



Tim:
 Hey yeah, it is him, isn't it?



Helen:
It is, you know, but who's that with him? Are they his kids? Alice? Has Paul got children?



Alice:
Yes, he's got two children actually.



Tim:
So that means he's got a wife.



Alice:
They're not together any more, and they're getting a divorce. 


Tim:
Are you sure about that?



Alice:
Well, that's what he told me, and I believe him. He's a good man.



Helen:
Ooh, Alice, you're skating on very thin ice.



Alice:
Maybe I am Helen, but I can't let him go.



Helen:
You really love him, don't you?



Alice:
Helen, I really do.
Episode 83: The rent



Helen:

Dad, Khalid likes the room, and he wants to move in, but he wants to know if you can knock a bit off the rent.



Helen's dad:

Helen, you know I can't allow it. Everybody has to pay the same.



Helen:

I know dad, but we put the advert in the Gazette for 2 weeks, and he's the only person who's anywhere near suitable.  It's going to cost a fortune if you have to keep advertising.



Helen's dad:

But why couldn't you find anybody through the ad?



Helen:

I don't know dad, I can't make people call. All I know is, Khalid's just right for the room, but if you want him to move in, you'll have to let him have a discount.



Helen's dad:

Well, I suppose I could let him have a small reduction. But what are you going to say to Alice and Tim?
Episode 84: A visit from the police



Police 1:

You see sir, we've received a complaint from a Mr Hall about a gentleman's watch that you sold to his wife just before Christmas. It would appear that the authenticity of the watch is in doubt.     



Tim:

Oh - Oh, I see...



Police 1:

Would you mind answering a few questions for us? 



Tim:

Well, no, but I think you should be talking to my boss about this.



Police 2:

We've already spoken to your boss sir, at some length as it happens. That's why we'd like to talk to you now. So, if you wouldn't mind answering a few questions...



Tim:

What, here?



Police 2:

We can always go down to the station if you think you'd be more comfortable there, sir...



Tim:

No, no, that won't be necessary. Would you like to come through to the office?
Episode 85: Talking to the police



Police 1:

So sir: a number of fake watches have been handed in to us over the last few months, and almost all of them have been traced to this establishment. Can you explain this? 



Tim:

Err, I'm not sure. We do use a reputable supplier.



Police 1:

Indeed. Your supplier wrote to you to tell you that some of the broken watches that you returned to them were fakes, didn't they?



Tim:

Well yes, they did, but... look officer, I'm only the assistant manager.



Police 1:

And your point is?



Tim:

Well, like I said, I think you need to speak to my boss.



Police 2:

And like I said sir, we have talked to your boss. Apparently, you are in charge of all the watches that come through this department.



Tim:

Well, technically, yes, that's true.



Police 2:

So, enlighten me: where did all these fake watches come from?
Episode 87: Hot water 


Boss:

 Look Tim, it looks like we're in a bit of hot water here. 


Tim:

 We? You mean you're in hot water. I haven't done anything. This is your problem: you've made your bed, and now you have to lie in it. 


Boss:

 Now that's not quite true, is it Tim? You're in charge of the stockroom, and you sold the watches, didn't you? 


Tim:

 Well yes, but...


Boss:

 So you could easily have switched the real watches for fakes. You sold the real ones yourself and made a nice little profit. 


Tim:

 You know that's not true. 


Boss:

 But you can't prove it, can you? 


Tim:

 Well, no, but...


Boss:

 Don't worry Tim, I've got a little plan. It's not quite on the level, but it should get us both out of the soup.
Episode 9:
The favour


Michal:
I'm going to see a film tonight. Will anyone like to come with me?


Alice:
Oh I'd love to Michal but I have to iron all these shirts for Tim.


Helen:
Look, why don't you go with Michal and I'll iron the shirts? 


Michal:
Oh Helen, that's so kind of you. 


Alice:
But don't you want to go to the cinema too? 


Helen:
	Yes but I need to study. I'll do the shirts, phone the landlord about keeping the cat and then I'll hit the books.


Alice:
Oh thanks, we owe you. Bye!


Michal:
Bye!


Helen:
Oh Cat! What could I do? They seem made for each other.
Episode 90: Khalid moves in 


Tim:

 Where do you want this bag, Khalid?



Helen:

                Khalid, what shall I do with these books?


Khalid:

                Just put everything over there, next to the door, thanks.


Alice:

              Tea's ready, everyone!


Tim:

              Ooh, lovely. Come on, Khalid, tea's up!


Khalid:

              Mmm, thanks Alice. And thanks Tim and Helen for giving me a hand with all my stuff. It would have taken me ages on my own.


Tim:

            Many hands make light work! I'm glad I could help. And it's nice to have something to do with my time now that I'm unemployed. 


Helen:

            Oh Tim, I'm sure something will turn up soon.


Tim:

            Well, let's hope so, otherwise I'm going to have a lot more time on my hands. Anyway Khalid, fancy a game of footy in the park after this?


Alice:

            Guys, this place is a complete tip! At least help tidy up first!
Episode 91: The truth about the watches


Police 1:

Could you just sign here please?



Tim:

                Yeah, sure. Can I do anything else to help?


Police 1:

                I think we have everything we need. We've been watching your boss, I mean, your ex-boss, for some time, and we've long suspected that he was involved in a counterfeiting ring. With the statement you've just given us, the CCTV evidence, and Mrs Hall's statement too, I think we've got enough to secure a conviction. 


Tim:

              Mrs Hall?
			  


Police 2:

              Janet Hall: the rather posh customer who bought a watch from you just
before Christmas. She recognised almost immediately that it was a fake, so she came to us straight away. But she was adamant that you couldn't have been responsible. She said something about some lost money that you returned to her.



Tim:

             Oh yeah, that. But when you interviewed me the other week you really seemed to think that I'd stolen the watches.


Police 2 :

            Just doing our job, sir.
Episode 93: An old friend calls


Tim:

 Hello?



Janet:

 It's Janet Hall here.



Tim:

Janet! How did you get my number?


Janet:

 Oh, a bit of detective work and a chat with a lovely gal in the Human Resources department.



Tim:

 Well, I'm glad you called. I've got so much to thank you for. I was branded a cheat, a liar and a thief, but because of you I'm beginning to clear my name.



Janet:

 It was nothing, honestly. The truth will out, as they say. But all's not quite well with you yet. I hear you got the boot.



Tim:

 No, I quit. It was a matter of principle. But you're right - quit, fired - it comes to the same thing. No job, no money, no prospects. 


Janet:

 And you think I'd stand for that?
Episode 94: A quiet night in


Alice:

 Ah, something smells fantastic! You're a whiz in the kitchen Paul.



Paul:

 Thank you. 



Ellie:

Yes, my daddy's a wonderful cooker. He's the bestest daddy in the whole wide world. 


Alice:

And you're the luckiest 5 year old, Ellie. 



Paul:

Oh, that's the pager. What is it now? Oh no, serious traffic incident. They want me at the hospital right away. 



Alice:

 Oh, I'll come too. I'm sure they'll need some extra nurses.



Paul:

 That's so professional of you Alice. But could I ask you to do me a huge favour here instead? 



Alice:

 Sure. What is it? 


Paul:

 Would you mind looking after Ellie?



Alice:

 Oh Paul, you don't even need to ask.
Episode 95: A letter from Poland


Helen:

 Dear Helen,
		I've been thinking about you a lot lately. Remembering our good and bad times. 
		You coming into the kitchen and thinking something was going on with me and Alice. 
		That huge fight we had about John cheating in his exam. 
		So many memories - more sad than happy - but you'll always have a special place in my heart. 
		Helen, time moves on and so have I. It's difficult to tell you this, especially in a letter, 
		but I've got to let you know. I've fallen in love here in Poland.
		I'm sorry to hurt you. We need to let each other go now. 
		Please don't write back. 
		Michal
Episode 96: Babysitting


Alice:

 Well it's almost bedtime. Time for you to go upstairs.



Ellie:

 I don't want to go to bed. I want to stay down here with you.  



Alice:

Well you know I'd love to have your company.


Ellie:

Then let me stay down and watch TV. 



Alice:

Ellie, I don't think that's such a good idea. You have to get up for school in the morning. 



Ellie:

School? I hate school!



Alice:

I'm sure you don't.



Ellie:

I do. I hate school and I hate bed. You can't make me go upstairs. 



Alice:

Oh I think I can.



Ellie:

No you can't. You're not my mummy. You can't make me do anything. I hate you!
Episode 97: Negotiating


Tim:

 Helen can I talk to you?



Helen:

 OK but nothing heavy. I'm not in the mood.   



Tim:

               It's just that I don't think I can make the rent this month.


Helen:

Oh Tim! What am I supposed to do? 



Tim:

I just think there needs to be some fairness around here. Khalid's only paying £75 a week. I'm unemployed and I think I should be paying the same.



Helen:

Sorry Tim. No can do.



Tim:

But that's not fair!



Helen:

Listen Tim, life's not fair. I love Michal but I'm never going to see him again. That's life! I'm dealing with my problems. Now, grow up and deal with your own!



Tim:

Thanks for the sympathy.
Episode 98: Temper tantrums


Paul:
Hi! I'm back!




Alice:
You must be exhausted. Have you been working all night? 
  



Paul:
Yes but at least we dealt with most of the casualties. How was your evening?
               
			   
			   


Alice:
 Oh so-so. 




Paul:
 Was Ellie OK? 




Alice:
 She was quite problematic, actually. You should have warned me. 




Paul:
 What about? What did you do to her? She's a perfectly normal 5 year-old. 




Alice:
 Normal? You think it's normal to have a temper tantrum, behave like a spoilt brat and only go to bed because you're ordered to? If that's what you call normal, maybe your parenting skills aren't quite as great as you think they are. Now, I'm going home for some well-earned rest. 
			  



Paul:
 Alice! 




Alice:
 And next time you need a babysitter, find some other mug!
Episode 99: Girl Talk 


Alice:
It's only me. Can I come in? 




Helen:
Yes but don't look at me. I'm a mess. 
  



Alice:
Helen, you've been crying. What's wrong?
               
			   
			   


Helen:
 I've just had some really bad news from Michal. He's fallen in love with 		someone else and doesn't want me to contact him ever again.




Alice:
Oh, you poor thing. 




Helen:
I mean it wasn't as if I didn't see it coming. But still it's a shock to see it all 		down in black and white. 




Alice:
 That's awful. 




Helen:
 But you know what the worst thing is? Poor Tim got the brunt of it all. He 		just wanted to have a chat with me and I completely went off on one. Alice?
