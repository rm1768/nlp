A: That game sounds like a lot of fun!
B: It really is! You should download it.
A: Alright! Then I can compete against you!

A: I'd like to make a reservation.
B: Can you tell me what dates you would like to stay?
A: I want to stay from April first through the third.
B: That's two nights. What kind of room would you like?
A: I'd like an economy room, please.

B: We need a credit card so we can hold your reservation.
A: What if I need to cancel?

A: Are you ready for dinner?
B: I sure am. Where are we going?
A: I thought we could try the new Italian place.
B: Oh, that's so heavy.
A: That's never bothered you before.
B: I know. The food is good, but it's a ton of carbs, and calories.
A: But very tasty.
B: We should try eating healthier.
A: So what do you suggest?
B: How about the Thai Hut?
A: You know I like that place, too. So what's the difference.
B: It's just not as heavy. Let's go there, okay?



A: Dating is really complicated.
B: What makes you say that?
A: You just can't pick somebody up at a bar anymore.
B: So what do you do now?
A: There are dating websites, dating apps, even dating clubs.
B: My friend set me up on a blind date with my now boyfriend.
A: I need a friend like that.
B: I'll help you create an online dating profile.
A: I'm wary about meeting people online.
B: It's not that different from meeting a stranger on the street.
A: Dating sure isn't what it used to be.
B: I think there are more options now. That's a good thing.



A: I have finally saved up enough to buy my first car.
B: That's great, dear. Do you have a car in mind?
A: I want a Honda Civic. I like to drive stick.
B: Have you been looking around?
A: Yes, I checked online. I have also been to some dealers.
B: You have to be careful when you go to dealers.
A: I know. They will try to take advantage of people.
B: Yes, you should take somebody that knows about cars.
A: Yeah, I'm going to take Joseph. He knows everything about cars.
B: Good idea. How much are you planning to spend?
A: I have $20,000.
B: Wow. Are you going to pay for the car? Or will you be making payments?
A: I was thinking about making payments. I don't want to get stuck without cash.
B: That sounds like a good idea.



A: I don't know which class to register for.
B: You should pick the class you need.
A: I know I need a science class.
B: I would take biology with Mr. Green.
A: It's a challenging yet fun class.
B: I don't like challenges.
A: Why are you in college then?
B: My mom forced me to enroll.
A: You should go to a vocational school instead.
B: I don't think you understand. My mom is scary.
A: Okay, fine. I recommend Earth Science 125 with Mr. Anderson.
B: Thanks for the recommendation!



A: Are you voting?
B: Is Election Day coming up?
A: It is. Election day is the first Tuesday in November.
B: I'm not sure if I'm even registered.
A: Did you fill out a registration form?
B: I did, and I think I got a card in the mail.
A: That's your voter card. So you are all set.
B: Are you going to vote?
A: I am going to vote. Why don't we go together?
B: That's a great idea. I still need to decide who I'm voting for.
A: I received so many mailings from all the candidates.
B: I'm going to go to your house and read them to help me decide.



A: Hey Richard, are you busy today?
B: I have a couple of errands to run, but I should be done early.
A: If you have time this afternoon, do you want to go with me?
B: Sure! Where are you going?
A: I'm going to an open house in San Gabriel today.
B: I didn't know you were looking for a house.
A: I am not ready to buy today. I'm just checking the market out.
B: That's very smart.
A: I want to see what I can afford.
B: That makes total sense. Count me in.
A: Okay, then I'll pick you up at about 3 p.m. Is that okay?
B: Yes, I should be done by then. Thanks.



A: Hello, neighbor. I would like to personally welcome you to the neighborhood.
B: Thank you. It is a pleasure to meet you.
A: Same here. It's been a few days. How do you like it so far?
B: I like it. It's convenient for both my job and my family.
A: That's good to hear. You'll find this neighborhood to be very peaceful.
B: That's another thing I like about it. My wife thinks the area looks lovely.
A: Are you doing anything tomorrow afternoon?
B: No, why do you ask?
A: I'm having a barbecue in my backyard. I want to invite you and your family.
B: Sure, I'd be happy to join!
A: Alright. Here's my number. I'll see you tomorrow!
B: Thank you. I'll see you then.



A: Hello, how are you doing?
B: I am doing quite well, how are you?
A: I've been better. I'm completely swamped with work.
B: I know the feeling. My boss works me hard, too.
A: Enough about work. How are the kids?
B: They are good. The oldest is about to graduate from high school.
A: You're kidding me! That's great, man.
B: The youngest is about to start middle school soon.
A: My son is about to start middle school as well.
B: Hey, maybe they will be classmates.
A: It's a strong possibility.
B: Yeah. Well, I want to try and beat the traffic. Good-bye.
A: Have a good one.



A:I don't understand how health insurance works in the U.S.
B: Do you have health insurance through your job?
A: I'm a part-time employee, so that is not part of my benefits package.
B: You can buy health insurance based on your income.
A: How exactly does that work?
B: If you go to healthcare.gov, you can see what plans you are eligible for.
A: Then what happens?
B: You pay a fee every month and choose a primary care doctor from your plan.
A: What is a primary care doctor?
B: A primary care doctor is the doctor you visit when you have a headache or for regular check-ups.
A: Do I go to my primary care doctor in an emergency?
B: No, in an emergency, you just go to the closest emergency room.



A: Can you help me find an apartment?
B: Sure, I would be happy to help.
A: I'm having trouble starting my search.
B: I would try driving around the neighborhood, and looking for any signs that say RENT.
A: That's a good start. Thank you.
B: Don't mention it.
A: Do you have any other advice you can offer?
B: Yes. Try searching on the Internet for apartments.
A: The Internet? Are you sure?
B: The Internet is a great place for people to sell and buy all sorts of things.
A: Even renting out apartments?
B: Yes, even that. Just be sure to always be safe in all transactions.
A: Thank you for your help.
B: You're welcome.



A: Hey Dennis, this is Ron. How's it going?
B: Hi, Ron. I'm looking for a summer job. I was hoping you could help me.
A: Okay, how can I help you?
B: Well, I was wondering if you could hook me up at the place you work.
A: No problem. I don't know if they're hiring, but I'll find out.
B: Aw man, you're the bomb!
A: What kind of job you are interested in doing?
B: Anything you think that I can do will be fine.
A: I'll talk to my boss in the morning and get back to you.
B: Thanks, man. A friend in need is a friend indeed.
A: Anything else you need me to do?
B: No. I'm waiting to hear from you.



A: What are you going to do this weekend?
B: I haven't made any solid plans yet. Why do you ask?
A: There's this event at a bookstore downtown I was thinking of checking out.
B: That sounds really interesting.
A: Yeah, and even if it's not, we can leave and grab a bite.
B: There are so many nice new places that have opened up downtown.
A: I know, and have wanted to try them all.
B: So our meeting time is Saturday at three.
A: I'll meet you at the bookstore.
B: It's the bookstore on Spring Street.
A: We can grab some food and drinks after.
B: An early dinner sounds great.



A: I'm a bit nervous, Charlie.
B: Why, baby?
A: Well, you know, new neighborhood, new surroundings.
B: Change is good, Linda. Before long, you'll feel right at home.
A: I hope so. I guess I'm just used to the old place.
B: I know what you mean, baby, but this is a much better neighborhood.
A: Yes, it is, but it's still something new.
B: We'll be fine. In a month it will feel like home.
A: I hope our neighbors are nice.
B: Me too, but that's not a deal-breaker. This is a much better place.
A: I know, dear. It's just my jitters, that's all.
B: We will get through this, babe.



A: I'm applying to transfer out of this college.
B: I'm going to miss you. 
A: Me too. I'll text you every so often.
B: Why do you want to transfer?
A: I don't think here it is challenging enough for me.
B: You can join the honors program!
A: I did, and it wasn't challenging either.
B: Alright then. When are you going to start applying?
A: Next month. I'm already looking at the essay prompts.
B: Are they challenging?
A: Yes, but they're kind of fun!
B: I hope you get into wherever you want to go.



A: Now that we found our new home, it's time to sell our old one.
B: I know. It makes me sad.
A: Why is that, Dorothy?
B: I don't know. I guess it's because we've lived here so long.
A: I know, baby. But it's time to move on.
B: Yes, I know. The kids are all grown up now.
A: I'll contact our realtor tomorrow.
B: Are you going to use the same one?
A: No, I don't think so. I think I'll try someone new.
B: Why is that?
A: No reason, really. I just want to check around. We're in no hurry.
B: That's true. I'm good with that.



A: Check out my birthday haul!
B: Wow, that's a lot of cash!
A: My relatives were really generous.
B: What are you gonna buy with it?
A: Well, I'm going to save half of it.
B: What?! You could buy so much with this!
A: I know, but I want to save some for later.
B: Well, maybe you can still afford that new video game.
A: No way! I'm going to stretch this money.
B: How are you going to do that?
A: I'm going to buy used games instead.
B: Well, I guess a used game is better than nothing.



A: Hey Diana, why so glum?
B: Aw Bobby, I just lost my job.
A: Oh, no. What happened?
B: The company is relocating to another state.
A: That's tough, Diana. What are you going to do now?
B: I'm looking for a new job. I need to pay my bills.
A: Are you filing for unemployment benefits?
B: I don't think I'm eligible. I only worked there three months.
A: Sure, you're eligible. You worked long enough.
B: I didn't know that.
A: I think you only have to work for two weeks to be eligible.
B: That's great. I hope I can get it.
A: You'll never know untill you try.
B: Thanks, Bobby. You're a good friend.



A: Thank you for coming to our travel agency. How can I help you?
B: I would like to book a trip to Disney World for my family.
A: Your family will have much fun. When do you want to go?
B: We want to go during the summer when the kids have off from school.
A: I suggest early June because it won't rain too much and the park isn't as crowded as later in the season.
B: Great! let's do the second week in June.
A: How many adults and how many children will be travelling?
B: There are two adults and two children.
A: Do you have an airline preference?
B: No. I have no preference as long as the flight is non-stop.
A: Do you want a budget hotel or a luxury hotel?
B: Can you book something in between?



A: I'm starving!
B: Me too. Let's get something to eat.
A: What would you like?
B: I know! Let's go down to the Farmer's Market.
A: What do they sell to eat there?
B: Only the best produce in the city!
A: What makes it so great?
B: Well it's all organically grown.
A: Can't we just go to the supermarket?
B: No way! Those vegetables don't compare at all!
A: I don't feel like cooking. Let's get burgers.
B: Fine, let's get some burgers.



A: You seem a little lost.
B: I actually am lost. How could you tell?
A: The look on your face said it all.
B: Maybe you could help me.
A: I'd be happy to help.
B: I'm not sure what bus I'm supposed to take.
A: What's your destination?
B: I'm heading to Westwood.
A: I've been there several times by bus.
B: You have? What bus did you take?
A: The Line 720 takes you directly there.
B: Where is the stop for that bus?
A: Right at the corner over there.
B: Thank you very much.



A: I desperately need to take an English class this semester.
B: So does everyone else.
A: It's the only class I need before I transfer.
B: Maybe you can pay someone for their spot. 
A: I honestly would do that if someone was willing to give up their spot.
B: What happens if you can't get the class?
A: Then I need to stay at Pasadena City College longer.
B: That would stink.
A: I know, that's why I need that class.
B: You can try taking it at another college.
A: I might do that. The closest community college is a two-hour drive.
B: I'm praying you get the English class.



A: Tell me about the apartment's safety features.
B: What would you like to know?
A: Do the front and back door equip with locks?
B: But of course, they do.
A: What kind of locks do they have?
B: The best deadbolt locks in town.
A: I'm glad to hear that.
B: Rest assured that you will be safe and sound in your new apartment.
A: That's comforting to hear. I thank you for your words.
B: Not a problem. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
A: Let me think for a second.
B: Take all the time you need.
A: Alright, I got one.
B: Okay, let's hear it.
A: Does the apartment have an alarm system?
B: It in fact does! It's a very important safety feature to have.



A: Is there a gym in this hotel?
B: Yes, the fitness center is located on the third floor.
A: Is there a charge for me to use it?
B: No, it's free to all of our guests.
A: Wonderful! Can I go use it right now?
B: Unfortunately, the gym is only open from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. and it's 10 p.m. now.
A: I guess I'll use it in the morning then.
B: Just use your room key card to get in.
A: Are there weight machines?
B: The gym has weight machines, some treadmills, and some elliptical machines, too.
A: What about a personal trainer?
B: No, there are no personal trainers, just the machines.



A: This is my first time voting and I need some help.
B: I'll be happy to help you. What's your name and address?
A: Here's my identification.
B: You are in the right place.
A: How do you know?
B: Your name is right here. Sign next to the image of your signature.
A: Okay, sign here. Then what?
B: Then you are ready to vote.
A: Where do I do that?
B: You can use that empty booth right behind you.
A: You are so helpful.
B: I'm just doing my job as a poll worker.



A: Good morning. How are you today?
B: I'm doing well. Thank you.
A: Are you here for our workshop today?
B: Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.
A: That's wonderful. This will help quite a bit.
B: Will you be giving the workshop?
A: Yes I will, with a couple of my colleagues.
B: How many people are you expecting?
A: Not many, unfortunately.
B: What do you mean?
A: Everyone should attend if possible. This makes filing so easy.
B: I'll tell my friend Joseph. He's coming tomorrow.



A: I love it when people fall on the red carpet!
B: Why would you like watching that?
A: It's funny to see someone famous fall!
B: I think it's mean to laugh at anyone falling.
A: You laughed at me when I fell last time!
B: Well, how would you like it if you fell on national TV?
A: I guess that would be embarrassing.
B: You should always put yourself in others' shoes!
A: I still think it's pretty funny, though.
B: Haven't you learned your lesson?
A: Yes. If I fell on national TV, I'd be the first person to laugh.
B: I guess that's a good attitude to have.



A: Can I borrow your class notes from yesterday's lecture?
B: Heck no! You're so lazy.
A: What are you talking about? I was sick yesterday.
B: I don't care. Ask someone else.
A: You're so mean!
B: I can't let anyone borrow my class notes.
A: Why not? They're just notes.
B: I let a classmate borrow my notes once, and she sold copies to people.
A: That's crazy! For how much?
B: She sold each class note set for $5.
A: Don't worry, I promise not to sell your notes.
B: I can't take your word for it.



A: There's a huge rip here.
B: But there's tape on it!
A: Did you put the tape there?
B: No, it was there before.
A: I know you're lying to me.
B: If you know, then why did you ask if I put the tape on?
A: I wanted to see if you were a liar or not.
B: How did you know I'm lying?
A: Before you check out the book, the librarian checks it for damage.
B: Wow, you guys think of everything.
A: Yes. Anyways, you owe $10.
B: Fine, here you go.



A: How long have we've been waiting for this bus?
B: Almost one hour. I think it's late.
A: It is late! What is taking this bus driver so long to get here?
B: Probably traffic. You know how traffic could be on the weekends.
A: That is not a good excuse. Bus drivers should know how to maneuver past traffic.
B: That's easy for you to say.
A: I just want the bus to arrive already. I want to go home.
B: It's bound to arrive any minute now.
A: I hope you're right. My patience has all extinguished.
B: Wait. I think I see it coming in the distance!
A: Thank goodness! I couldn't possibly wait another minute.
B: False alarm. It was just a truck. Sorry about that.



A: Good day, Thomas. We have an offer on your house.
B: That's good! I hope it's better than the last one.
A: It is, Thomas.
B: Okay, let's hear it.
A: The offer is $275,000.
B: $275,000! That's $35,000 under the listing.
A: I know, Thomas, but I think we should consider it.
B: Why would I consider this price?
A: We should counteroffer. I think we can work with this buyer.
B: I won't take less than $300,000. You know that.
A: Let's consider the counteroffer. The house has issues.
B: Okay, I listen to you.



A: Mr. Lee, the seller has made a counteroffer on his home.
B: He did not accept my original offer?
A: Technically he did, but he has conditions.
B: Okay, what are they?
A: He said your offer of $325,000 was a bit short.
B: What's his counteroffer?
A: He wants $335,000, and he'll throw in the appliances.
B: I don't know. Will the appliances have a warranty?
A: No. No warranty.
B: I'm going to have to think about this, Ms. Phillips.
A: Take your time. Counteroffers are common.
B: I need to talk to my wife about this. I'll get back to you.



A: What brings you into my examination room today?
B: I'm here because your receptionist told me I needed to come in to discuss my test results.
A: Well, let me take a look at your file.
B: The receptionist made me nervous when she wouldn't tell me the results over the phone.
A: Legally she can't tell you the results.
B: So is it bad, doctor?
A: Your cholesterol is a little high.
B: Does that mean I'm going to die.
A: Let's not exaggerate.
B: I'm going to be okay?
A: If you change your diet and exercise more, you will be fine.
B: I will do whatever it takes to be healthy.



A: C'mon, guess what?
B: I don't know, chicken butt?
A: Stop playing games. I got the part in the school play!
B: Really? That's great!
A: All this practice is finally paying off.
B: Yes, it is. I can't believe it!
A: Same here. I'm going to be the main character!
B: I'm so proud of you. I can't wait to see the play.
A: It's going to be a lot of hard work, but I'm glad I got the part.
B: When does the play open?
A: It opens in three weeks.
B: Great. Get me a ticket. I want to be sitting in the front row.



A: It's been so long since I've seen you!
B: I know. You haven't changed a bit.
A: Oh, stop lying. I've gained a little weight.
B: We all have gained some weight.
A: Tell me how the kids are doing.
B: They are doing well, and yours?
A: They are doing so well, growing up so fast.
B: Are you at the same job or are you doing something else?
A: No. I left that place three years ago to start my own business.
B: Congratulations! You always had an independent spirit.
A: Thanks. It's going really well so far.
B: I'd love to hear more about it over a cup of coffee.



A: I need to wash my clothes.
B: As a tenant of this apartment, you have access to the washer and dryer.
A: Is that so? I didn't know that.
B: It's good that you know now.
A: Are there any laundry rules I should know about?
B: Yes. There are certain hours you are allowed to use the laundry room.
A: What are the hours?
B: You are only allowed to wash clothes from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
A: That's good to know. Is there anything else I should know?
B: You're responsible for your belongings.
A: Well, that's common knowledge.
B: Also, there is no food or drink allowed in the laundry room.
A: Thanks for going over the rules and hours with me.
B: It was my pleasure to help a fellow neighbor.



A: Here's your dinner, folks. Enjoy!
B: Thank you. This looks delicious.
A: You're welcome.
B: Excuse me.
A: Yes, how can I help you?
B: This salmon steak tastes a little funny.
A: Funny? In what way?
B: I don't know for sure, but, I think it might be spoiled.
A: Not to worry. We will bring you a new steak.
B: Yes, please do. This one turned my stomach.
A: Oh, no. Are you okay?
B: I think so, but I'm not in the mood for dinner now.
A: That's perfectly alright. We will refund your money.



A: What kind of meat are you buying?
B: I'm just buying some pork shoulders.
A: Why did you make them cut it in half?
B: It's tenderer if you do it that way.
A: Do you need anything else?
B: Yes, I need some tenderloin pieces.
A: You sure are buying a lot of meat.
B: Meat makes you strong!
A: And it also tastes amazing!
B: Would you like to come over for dinner?
A: Sure! I'd like to see how well you cook.
B: Alright! You'll find it delicious!



A: I love my new hairstyle!
B: Beauty takes work!
A: And this is your best work yet!
B: Thank you, I'm glad you're satisfied!
A: How much do I owe you?
B: Well, there was the haircut, and you also got the highlights.
A: Not to mention the lowlights.
B: That'll be $45.
A: Prices have sure gone up over time!
B: Yes, but beauty is worth it!
A: When I look this good, I guess you're right.
B: Thank you for letting me cut your hair.



A: Dad, I got a parking ticket at school.
B: Well, you should pay it off as soon as possible.
A: Where can I pay it off?
B: You can go to Downtown and go to the court there.
A: Can I pay it off online?
B: Yes, you can. Look at the fine. It should give a website.
A: Oh, okay. Let me go get the ticket. It's in my car.
B: Hurry, because I need to leave to work.
A: Oh, wait. I forgot I put it in my wallet.
B: Well, take it out. Look in the back. It should give you a website.
A: Yes, it's in the back. Am I going to pay with my debit card?
B: Yes, do you have the money to pay?



A: I'll pick you up at the airport when you come back from your business trip.
B: I'm taking the red-eye, so I land early in the morning.
A: Tell me the airline and terminal number so I know where to get you.
B: I'm taking Jet Air so that's terminal 4.
A: Call me when you land.
B: My flight comes in at 6 a.m., so just wait for me then.
A: Cars aren't allowed to wait outside the terminal for more than a few minutes.
B: I don't want to have to wait at the curb for too long.
A: Well, I don't want to get a ticket.
B: Fine, I'll call you when I'm at the baggage claim.
A: Call me after you get your bags from the baggage claim.
B: Fine, but don't make me wait too long for you.



A: How do you plea to the charges?
B: I plead not guilty.
A: There are several witnesses that can testify to you being the robber.
B: I understand that, Your Honour. But I did not do it.
A: There is video surveillance that shows you robbing the victim.
B: I would like to review that evidence, Your Honour.
A: Your attorney can provide you with that evidence.
B: I am sure I can prove my innocence once I see the footage.
A: Would you like to present any of that evidence now?
B: May I confer with my attorney?
A: I can call a half hour recess.
B: I won't need more time than that, Your Honour.



A: Were you invited to Barb's birthday party?
B: I was. It should be really fun.
A: Do you have a date for the party?
B: As a matter of fact I don't have.
A: Do you want to have a date for the party?
B: Do you know someone?
A: I was thinking maybe you'd want to go as my date.
B: Oh. I don't think that's a good idea.
A: Why not? You said yourself it would be fun.
B: The party would be fun. Going with you would not be.
A: Wow, that's kind of harsh.
B: At least I'm honest.



A: Hey Alice, do you have a stapler I can use?
B: Of course I do. It's on my desk.
A: Thanks. Mine broke two weeks ago.
B: Didn't you put in a office supply request?
A: I asked Joseph if he would get me one.
B: I know he's in charge, but you should submit a form.
A: A form? What form?
B: An Office Supply form. Don't rely on Joseph. Put it in writing.
A: Oh, I could use a couple of other supplies, too.
B: Yes, by all means, get what you need.
A: Where are these forms?
B: I'll email it to you. Just print it, and send it in.
A: Thanks, Alice.
B: No problem.



A: This is the perfect birthday cake for my son!
B: What day do you need the cake?
A: His party is on Saturday.
B: Would you like to have it delivered?
A: Oh yes, please. Sometime in the morning would be perfect.
B: I can have someone drop it off at 10:30 a.m.
A: That sounds perfect! It's settled.
B: Great! That will be $20 for the cake and $5 for delivery.
A: Can the delivery man enter through the back door?
B: Of course! Just write down your address, please.
A: There, all done! I also wrote my phone number.
B: Alright, thank you! Have a good day!



A: You want to go for a walk?
B: Sure! Where to?
A: I was thinking of going to the park.
B: Isn't it a bit far?
A: Not really. We'll just take our time. It's very beautiful there.
B: Okay, let's go.
A: Look at the swans. Do you see them?
B: They're gorgeous. Look at how white those plumes are.
A: And the lake looks so calm.
B: It does. This was a great idea.
A: I know. I do this walk often.
B: I didn't even think it was that far; it's so beautiful.



A: So, I can give you the title transfer after you pay me.
B: Okay, I can pay you in full today.
A: That's great. I have the title transfer here with me.
B: Great, what do I need to do?
A: I just need you to fill in the information on this form.
B: And then you are going to take it to the DMV?
A: Yes, you should receive a notice from the DMV in the mail.
B: Okay, that sounds good.
A: Once you fill out everything, be sure to sign your name at the bottom.
B: Will do. When can you take the paper to the DMV?
A: I can take it later on today. If not, I can definitely take it tomorrow.
B: Awesome. I just want to get everything done fast.



A: I think your grading policy is unfair.
B: I beg your pardon?!
A: Why is a 90% a B?
B: I'm trying to challenge you guys.
A: That's not a challenge, that's a punishment.
B: I've had this policy since I started teaching.
A: It's time for a change.
B: I'm not changing my policy because you don't like it.
A: Put yourself in my shoes.
B: I have been a student once, and I think my policy is fair.
A: I'm going to drop your class!
B: Go ahead! Less for me to grade!



A: Can I get you something to drink?
B: I would love something to drink.
A: I have water, juice, ice tea or did you want something stronger?
B: Something stronger would be great. Do you have wine?
A: I do. Would you prefer red wine or white wine?
B: I'd love white, but it depends what kind you have.
A: I have Chardonnay.
B: That would be great. I'll take a glass.
A: Excellent! Should I also bring out some cheese and crackers.
B: That would go so well with the wine.
A: Great! Just give me a moment to get that from the kitchen.
B: You are such a wonderful host.



A: I thought you were going to cook dinner today.
B: I've been working all day.
A: Yeah, but you work from home. That doesn't count.
B: It sure seems to count when I help pay the bills.
A: You know I pay more bills than you do.
B: That's because you make more money than I do.
A: This is why you should make dinner.
B: You are so sexist.
A: Way to get off topic. This is about you not making dinner.
B: We can make dinner together or order in.
A: What's the point of you working from home but won't take care of the home.
B: You know what? I'm going out to eat by myself.



A: Do you have the floor plan to the apartment?
B: Yes I do. Would you like to take a look at it?
A: Yes I would, if you don't mind.
B: Not at all. By all means, take a look for yourself.
A: Where did you get this piece of paper of the floor plan?
B: I have access to this kind of information.
A: I see. Can you help me read this?
B: Sure I can. What would you like to know?
A: How big is the living room?
B: According to the floor plan it is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide.
A: Oh, so that's what those numbers mean.
B: Right. This apartment has a good floor plan.



A: Excuse me. Can you give me a minute of your time?
B: Sure, I don't see why not.
A: Thank you kindly. I'm pretty new in town, and I think I might be lost.
B: Do you need to make a phone call?
A: No, thank you. I just need some directions.
B: Where are you trying to get to?
A: I need to find my way back to Colorado Boulevard.
B: Colorado Boulevard? Why, you're not far off from there.
A: Can you point me towards the direction of that street?
B: Gladly! You're going to walk straight down this street.
A: Alright, straight down.
B: Then you make a right after two blocks.
A: Alright, I got that.
B: Then a left at the next street, and you should be there.
A: Thank you so much.
B: You're welcome. Have a safe trip.



A: There are some amenities missing from my hotel room.
B: I'm so sorry to hear that. What is your room number and what's missing?
A: I'm in room 143; there is no hairdryer.
B: I can send one up to you right away.
A: Great! So that I can use that hairdryer, can you also send up shampoo and conditioner?
B: There should have been a basket in the bathroom with all that.
A: Well, there isn't.
B: Anything else I can send up to your room?
A: Yes, I need an iron and an ironing board.
B: Those aren't in your closet?
A: Maybe they are invisible. I don't see them.
B: I do apologize. I'll bring them personally.



A: Here are the books I'm returning.
B: Looks like they're late. The late fee is $5.
A: Okay, I'm only one minute late.
B: One minute late, one month late, one year late, it doesn't matter.
A: Are you kidding me? There's a big difference between one minute and one month.
B: Look, the point is - they're late.
A: Screw you! I ain't payin $5.
B: I guess you'll never borrow another book, magazine, or video here ever again.
A: It's okay, because I don't even like this library.
B: This library doesn't like you either!
A: I am leaving! You are plain rude.
B: Leave! Nobody wants to see you.



A: Given the evidence that has just been provided, the court releases you.
B: I'm free to go, Your Honour?
A: You are free to go.
B: Thank you. I am happy justice has been served.
A: The court is pleased as well.
B: I don't ever plan to be back in this courtroom, Your Honour.
A: I sure hope not.
B: Your Honour, I didn't commit the crime I was accused of.
A: Do you know how many times I have heard that?
B: I'm sure many times, but I mean it.
A: Many people say they mean it, and I still see them before me.
B: I won't be one of those people.



A: I'm calling because I need to reschedule my appointment.
B: What was the original appointment date and time?
A: I am supposed to come in on Thursday at 10 in the morning.
B: Are you Tina Williams?
A: That's me.
B: When would you like to reschedule the appointment for?
A: Can Dr. Harris see me next Tuesday at 10?
B: He doesn't have an opening that day until noon.
A: I'll have to come on my lunch break then.
B: So shall I give you that appointment time?
A: Yeah, put me down for that time.
B: Just let us know 24 hours in advance if you need to cancel or reschedule.



A: That's an awesome shirt.
B: Thank you. It's so nice of you to say.
A: Where did you get it?
B: I got it at a store at the mall.
A: The mall? Did it cost a lot? Things are usually overpriced there.
B: Actually, it was quite cheap. I got it for $15.99.
A: That is pretty cheap. Do they have it in other colors?
B: You want to go get one?
A: Yeah, I like how it looks. Would you want to come with me?
B: We can go after school, if you want?
A: That would be great. I need new clothes, but I don't know what to buy.
B: I'll help you pick out something cute.



A: Do you know why I stopped you?
B: No, officer. Why?
A: You failed to stop at the stop sign.
B: I'm sorry, officer. I didn't see the stop sign.
A: Have you had anything to drink?
B: No, I have not. Do you need to see my license?
A: Yes, I need your license and registration.
B: Okay, here is my paperwork.
A: I will be back. I need to check your background.
B: Sure thing, officer.
A: Everything seems to be in order. I'm going to give you a warning.
B: Thank you, officer. I'll be more careful.



A: Wait a second. Where am I?
B: You're in Los Angeles.
A: Los Angeles? Oh, no. I got off the bus too early.
B: Where were you going to?
A: I need to get to Westwood.
B: Just hop on the next bus.
A: And wait exactly how long for it?
B: Not long. I can tell you that.
A: Maybe I should just take a taxi.
B: Take my word, young man, the next bus won't take long.
B: When will the next one arrive?
A: I'd say in less than ten minutes.



A: Do you have your customs form?
B: Yes, I filled it out on the plane.
A: I also need your passport.
B: I'm a U.S. citizen.
A: I still need to see your passport.
B: What other documents do you need?
A: Do you have anything to declare?
B: I bought some leather wallets in Morocco.
A: You're going to have to show them to me.
B: Are you going to take then away from me?
A: I'll only confiscate them if they are made of python skin.
B: They are just leather wallets.



A: That was an excellent meal. Don't you think so, Judy?
B: Absolutely! I especially liked the dessert.
A: Yes, me too. That chocolate cake was delicious.
B: Here comes our waitress.
A: Hello again, and thank you. That was very good.
B: Yes, the dessert was delicious.
A: I would like the bill, please.
B: Her service and attitude were good also. How much are you tipping her?
A: You're right about the service. I think 20 percent.
B: Twenty percent? That's a bit high, isn't it?
A: I know, but the food was good, and the service was excellent.
B: You're right, dear. She deserves it.



A: I was hoping you could help me.
B: I'll try. What help do you need?
A: I'm having an interview tomorrow morning. I'm very nervous.
B: That's great! Why are you nervous though?
A: I don't do well in interviews.
B: They can be frightening, but you can do it.
A: I'm afraid they'll ask me something I won't know.
B: You should prepare yourself. Go online, and look at their website.
A: Now why didn't I think of that?
B: It's a good idea to know everything you can about them first.
A: That's an excellent idea! Thanks.
B: You're welcome. If you need more help, give me a call.



A: What have you done to my hair?
B: I did exactly what you told me to do.
A: I asked for a light trim, not for a butchering!
B: I had to cut out all the split ends.
A: I look like a grapefruit! My head is too round!
B: It's a short bob, very stylish.
A: It looks more like a bowl cut to me!
B: It looks fantastic, don't exaggerate.
A: I hate it! I'm not paying for this!
B: You have to pay me for my labor!
A: I'm never coming here ever again!
B: Trust me, you won't be missed.



A: Excuse me, but I'd like to make an appointment for next week.
B: I can help with that. Did you try doing it over the phone or online?
A: Yes, but it seemed so confusing.
B: I know what you mean. They are working on it.
A: Great. So, I wanted to come in sometime next week.
B: How does Monday sound?
A: Monday is no good. Is Wednesday okay?
B: Yes, Wednesday works. We have these times available.
A: I can come in at 10 a.m.
B: Great. I need your name and phone number.
A: My name is Christopher Clark and my phone number is (555) 323-2465
B: Great. We will see you on Wednesday.



A: I hope you are on your way to vote right now.
B: I am. And I'm actually voting for you!
A: Glad to hear that. I appreciate your vote.
B: Can I ask you a question?
A: That's why I'm out here today.
B: Do you really think you can change City Hall?
A: I am sure going to try.
B: See that's the reason why you have my vote.
A: Make sure you tell a friend to vote today.
B: Should I tell them to vote for you?
A: You don't have to, but it sure would be appreciated.
B: Every vote counts.



A: I want to watch a movie.
B: Nothing good is playing at the theater.
A: That's true. Plus, I don't have much money.
B: Do you have a Netflix account?
A: No, I don't.
B: Why don't we go rent a movie?
A: Is it expensive?
B: No, just a couple of dollars.
A: We can buy some snacks, too.
B: It will be like a mini trip to the movies.
A: That sounds good to me! Let's go.
B: I'm right behind you!



A: Hello, how can I help you?
B: I'm calling about your delivery service.
A: What seems to be the problem?
B: The delivery was scheduled to arrive over an hour ago.
A: Your cake has not arrived?
B: No, and I am very disappointed.
A: I'm sorry about that; we're a bit behind schedule.
B: You know I needed that cake an hour ago.
A: I understand. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
B: Will the delivery man be here soon?
A: Yes, he will. And he will refund you the delivery fee.
B: Alright. Thank you.



A: Hi, Michelle. What are you up to?
B: I'm looking for work online.
A: Cool! What kind of job are you looking for?
B: I need a part-time job, but I'm not doing too well.
A: I'm pretty good at this. Can I help?
B: You sure can.
A: Okay, let's see. You can narrow your search on this site.
B: How can I do that?
A: Go to the "Advanced Search" button and click on it.
B: I see it. Okay, now what?
A: There are many options. You can search by city, by job, or pay.
B: I see. Let me try searching by city. Thanks.



A: Let's take the kids to the park.
B: Hey, that sounds like a good idea!
A: Yes, the fresh air will do them good.
B: Yeah, they've been cooped up all week.
A: It's like summer out today.
B: Okay, I'll get them ready.
A: There is so much to do there.
B: What, like swings, and rides?
A: Yes, and much more. They're going to love it.
B: What have you planned?
A: I was thinking about taking them on a boat ride.
B: Oh, they'll love that. Can I go too?



A: Mr. Smith, we received a counteroffer on your house.
B: For which property?
A: It's for the lot on 6th Avenue.
B: Okay, I've been waiting for this.
A: Yes, and I think it is a very good offer.
B: Okay, lay it on me.
A: The buyer upped his offer to $375,000.
B: Are you kidding me? That's still $7,500 below list.
A: I know, Mr. Smith, but the market is weak right now.
B: I don't care. I'm not losing money on this.
A: You won't be losing money, sir.
B: I don't care. I'm not selling at that price.



A: Throw away those potato chips!
B: What's so bad about potato chips?
A: They'll rot your insides!
B: Oh, they're not so bad.
A: You should eat a different snack.
B: I think I'll have some frozen yogurt.
A: That is a much better snack!
B: I'd still like to eat potato chips though.
A: You had some yesterday.
B: I don't eat them very often.
A: You can have them later.
B: I guess that sounds pretty fair.



A: I want to transfer, but I don't know where to start.
B: Let's start with the basics. What do you want to major in?
A: I want to major in biology.
B: Then you have to take general education requirements like everyone else.
A: What are those requirements exactly?
B: I'll give you a sheet listing all of them. 
A: What else do I have to do?
B: You should fulfill some, if not all, of your major requirements.
A: Okay, about when will I finish?
B: It really depends on how many classes you take and complete per semester.
A: I'm planning on taking five classes per semester.
B: That's good! You'll be ready to transfer in about two years.



A: Hey Professor Lopez, I need a favor.
B: What kind of favor?
A: Can you write a recommendation letter for me?
B: I'm sorry, but I can't.
A: Why not? I was a good student.
B: Yes, you were. The thing is, I don't know you that well.
A: I'll just give you my resume, and you can write about how great I am!
B: I can't. I don't think I can write you a good letter.
A: But I don't know who else to ask.
B: Ask someone who knows you as more than just a student.
A: I honestly never had a professor I felt close to.
B: Then, you can only hope a professor writes a letter for you regardless of that fact.



A: The counteroffer we've been waiting for is here, Mr. Richards.
B: Finally. It's been nearly three weeks.
A: Well, these things take some time.
B: I know, but I wasn't happy with the original offer.
A: I think you'll be happy with this. The buyer is coming in just below list.
B: Exactly how much?
A: They came in at $415,000, with very few conditions.
B: Wow! That's only $10,000 below list. I didn't expect that.
A: Neither did I, Mr. Richards.
B: What are the conditions?
A: They're not too bad. Mostly just to fix a few minor flaws.
B: That's great. I think we'll take this counteroffer.



A: Did you water the plants?
B: I did this morning.
A: It doesn't look like you did.
B: Well, I did. Are you calling me a liar?
A: No. It's just I know sometimes you can be a little lazy.
B: Is this how you normally speak to people you are in a relationship with?
A: This is how I speak to people who are not doing what they are supposed to do.
B: Wow! I am really hurt by how you are talking to me.
A: Maybe you are feeling guilty.
B: No. I'm feeling like I made a mistake.
A: What do you mean?
B: I'm going to go for a walk before I say something I'm going to regret.



A: You look lost. Are you in need of any directions?
B: I was just about to ask someone for directions. Thank you for noticing.
A: Where are you from?
B: I'm from the inner city.
A: You're a long way from home then. Are you looking for a certain street?
B: Actually, I need directions to the nearest public bus.
A: Which bus number are you looking for?
B: I'm looking for Line 267.
A: I know that bus. The stop is just around that corner.
B: Where? Over there?
A: In that direction.
B: Thank you so much. I appreciate the help.
A: You're welcome. Safe travels, my friend.



A: Hello, my name is Sally. I am hoping you could help me.
B: Of course I can, that's what I'm here for.
A: I want to look for a job, but I don't have Internet access at home.
B: That's okay, let's get started.
A: Great! What do I do first?
B: You're going to need an email address. Do you have one?
A: Yes, I have my own email.
B: Okay, I can show you a couple of good websites for jobs.
A: That would be awesome! Thanks.
B: We also have job bulletins on that table over there. You can search through those, too.
A: Well, thank you, miss. I greatly appreciate your help.
B: No problem. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.



A: Is there a copy machine for guests?
B: Yes, we have copy machines in our business center, which is to your right.
A: I need to make a color copy.
B: There are two black and white machines and one color copier.
A: Is there a charge to use the machine?
B: The cost per sheet on the color copy machine is 25 cents.
A: Does the machine take credit cards?
B: No, but I'd be happy to give you change if you have bills.
A: I need to make four color copies, so give me change for a dollar.
B: The machine also takes one dollar bills, so you don't need change.
A: Is there usually a wait for the machines.
B: Our business center is pretty empty right now, so you should have the run of the place.



A: Hello, I'm here to renew my registration.
B: Okay, may I please have your renewal notice?
A: Yes, here it is. Do you need my driver's license?
B: No, this is fine. It seems you missed your deadline.
A: Yes, I completely forgot.
B: Well, it's going to cost you a bit more to renew it.
A: How much more will it cost?
B: It was going to be $88, now it's going to be $120.
A: Well, I guess I'm going to have to be more careful.
B: It would be a good idea. Have you done the smog check?
A: No, is that required?
B: It is this year. You'll have to do it again two years from now.
A: Can I come back tomorrow?
B: Yes. Don't wait in line. Come directly to me.



A: Hello, may I please talk to a store manager?
B: Yes. What seems to be the problem?
A: I scheduled some furniture to be delivered today.
B: Would you like to change the delivery time?
A: Yes. Something came up and I won't be home until 3 p.m.
B: That is not a problem, sir, I'll fix it.
A: Thank you. I was worried it had already been dispatched.
B: It's no problem at all.
A: Please tell the deliverymen to be aware of my dog.
B: Does he bite, sir?
A: No, but he may trip someone.
B: I'll make sure they're on high alert.



A: Miss, you have been using the computer for over an hour now.
B: I know, I'm sorry.
A: Are you looking for something?
B: I'm researching for my project.
A: Can you come back tomorrow? Your daily computer limit time is up.
B: I don't have a computer at home.
A: I'm sorry to hear that, but other people need to use the computer, too.
B: My project is due very soon. I need to research.
A: How about books? This is a library after all.
B: I looked for books on my project. They're not good at all.
A: Maybe you don't know how to look for good books. I'll help you.
B: Thank you. I appreciate it



A: Can I get you something to drink?
B: No, thanks. I just finished a whole bottle of water.
A: You won't mind if I have something then?
B: Of course not.
A: Can I offer you some fruit or cheese?
B: I just had lunch before I came here.
A: I really hope you don't mind if I eat because I haven't had lunch.
B: Go right ahead and do what you normally do.
A: I didn't eat because I assumed you would be joining me.
B: I hope you're not offended.
A: No, I'm not offended at all.
B: Oh, good. I ate before because I didn't want to impose.



A: Is there any kind of discrimination committed in the city?
B: Not that I have witnessed.
A: What about any reports?
B: Of discrimination? I wouldn't know, to be honest.
A: Do you know where I could get access to that kind of information?
B: Perhaps the police department. What made you ask in the first place?
A: I was just curious. It never hurts to ask.
B: I wouldn't worry too much about discrimination.
A: Why do you say that?
B: We live in progressive times now.
A: That doesn't mean discrimination isn't committed in this day and age.
B: I guess you are right.



A: I want to file a wrongful arrest lawsuit.
B: What proof do you have that you were wrongfully arrested?
A: Well, I didn't rob anybody.
B: Why were you arrested then?
A: I fit the description of the suspect.
B: Well, how was that a wrongful arrest?
A: They didn't investigate if I had a twin brother or not.
B: Do you have a twin brother?
A: I have an identical twin brother.
B: Did the police find out?
A: The police found out when I told them.
B: We may have a case then.



A: This is Joseph Walters, the inspector.
B: Hello, Joseph. I'm the buyer, Mrs. Smith
A: Hello, Mrs. Smith. I've done a preliminary check of the property.
B: That's great! What did you find?
A: There are some issues with this home.
B: For instance?
A: Structurally, the house is sound.
B: That's a good start, Joseph.
A: The plumbing is substandard, the water heater is old, and the roof has issues.
B: You're kidding, right?
A: I wish I was. I'll know more in a couple of days.
B: Okay, keep me informed.



A: Where do you want to go eat?
B: I'm not sure. Wait, watch out! The light is red!
A: Oh, damn. Well, there I passed it.
B: I think there was a cop at the light.
A: Can you check? Look behind you.
B: I don't see anything. Wait, there is a car turning the corner.
A: Is it a police car? Well, is it?
B: Oh, no. I think it is.
A: Well, hopefully he doesn't stop us.
B: Oh, no. He just turned on his lights.
A: Damn, I have to pull over.
B: Yes, I hope I don't get a ticket.



A: Is this Gage Avenue?
B: No, this is Florence Avenue.
A: Oh, no. I must've gotten off the bus too early.
B: Don't worry. We all make mistakes.
A: Thank you for that.
B: Maybe I can help you get to where you're going.
A: Are you sure it wouldn't be any trouble?
B: No trouble at all.
A: How much further is Gage Avenue?
B: Not too far. It's a fifteen-minute walk from here.
A: Can you please point me towards the right direction?
B: Sure. You're going to head south from here.
A: South is that way?
B: No that's north. South is the opposite way.



A: Can I have a minute?
B: What is going on?
A: I'm really not feeling very well this afternoon.
B: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.
A: Do you think I can leave the office early?
B: Well, I have some medication here on my desk.
A: I already took some pills and they really aren't helping.
B: It's just that we have the report due today.
A: I already gave Dennis what I have so far.
B: He knows how to finish it?
A: I emailed him detailed instructions.
B: All right, go home then, but leave your phone on so we can call you if we have questions.



A: I work for the Big City Newspaper, and I'm doing a story on Election Day.
B: I read that paper all the time!
A: Great! So I can interview you for my story?
B: I would love that!
A: Did you vote today?
B: I'm on my way home from voting now.
A: Who did you vote for?
B: I voted for our city's first female mayor.
A: Were there many people voting?
B: I think turnout was pretty low. It's a shame.
A: Why do you think that is?
B: I think people think all politicians are dishonest.



A: I'm bored. Do you want to do something?
B: What did you have in mind?
A: Do you want to go drink?
B: No, I have work tomorrow, and I don't want to be hung over.
A: You don't have to get wasted.
B: I know you. You won't shut your mouth until I get wasted.
A: Fine. Let's go to the record store. I hear they have new vinyl.
B: I'm down to go to the record store. I haven't been there in a while.
A: Actually, I don't feel like going to the record store.
B: Well, what do you want to do?
A: Let's go to the movies instead?
B: Yeah, that new movie that I want to see is out. Let's go.



A: Wow! Our order is sure taking long.
B: Yes, it is. It's been nearly 45 minutes now.
A: Well, maybe they're just very busy.
B: I don't know, dear. I was watching our waiter.
A: What did you see?
B: He actually handed in orders for two tables before us.
A: You mean after he took our order.
B: Yes. He was goofing off. I could see him from here.
A: How do you know he did this.
B: Like I said, I was watching. He forgot our order.
A: That's terrible.
B: Yes, well he's not going to get a good tip from me.



A: What are you playing?
B: I'm playing a new game I bought yesterday.
A: Is it one of those shooting games?
B: No, it's not a shooting game.
A: Is it a sports game?
B: It's a role-playing game.
A: What's a role-playing game?
B: You play as a character and complete missions.
A: That doesn't sound too hard.
B: Some of the missions take a lot of cleverness!
A: Then I'll stick to shooting games.
B: All that'll do is kill your brain cells.



A: I have a 89.5%.
B: Okay, so what?
A: It's really close to an A.
B: You know I don't round up.
A: But I really need a 4.0 GPA.
B: You get what you deserve.
A: I know I deserve an A. I always do great work and participate.
B: I can't change it.
A: Please? I'll wash your car.
B: Are you bribing me?
A: I just want an A.
B: I'll give you a C if you don't leave now.



A: Can I check in here at the curb?
B: Sure! Do you have any bags you need to check in?
A: I have one suitcase.
B: That will be $35.
A: Oh, but I paid online already.
B: Can I see your ID and I'll check for you.
A: Here is my driver's license.
B: Sorry about that. You did pay already.
A: I told you so.
B: Looks like you're leaving out of gate 12A, but check the screens inside.
A: Can my mom come with me to the gate?
B: Not unless she is flying with you.



A: I don't have any clean laundry for tomorrow!
B: Well, you should do your laundry then.
A: Laundry is such a hassle!
B: Pack the laundry bags and let's go to the Laundromat.
A: Oh, alright. I don't have much, though.
B: Do you have any quarters?
A: Yes. I have enough for the washer and dryer.
B: Alright then, let's get going.
A: This is going to take forever.
B: The longer you keep complaining, the longer it'll feel.
A: I'd rather be playing video games.
B: I'd rather you wore a clean shirt to school tomorrow.



A: Can you cut the vegetables, please?
B: How do you want me to cut them?
A: Cut the potatoes into big chunks.
B: What about the carrots?
A: Those you can cut in rounds.
B: Do I do the same to the celery?
A: No, you can cut that into strips.
B: There are so many ways to cut these things!
A: Yes, there really are!
B: Can I cut the zucchini into rounds?
A: That's what I was going to ask you to do.
B: Great! I'll get started now.



A: My professor wrote a really bad recommendation letter for me.
B: You read his recommendation letter?
A: Yeah. I couldn't resist.
B: This is why you shouldn't read it. You might not like what you see.
A: He wrote such boring things about me. 
B: What did he write?
A: Just that I'm a diligent student who does well.
B: At least it was nothing bad. You can always ask another professor.
A: I know, but I don't have time.
B: When do you need another recommendation letter by?
A: I need one by this Friday.
B: Oh, wow! Maybe you should just send the one you have now.



A: Hello, I wanted to ask you about car insurance prices.
B: Sure thing. Please, have a seat.
A: Thank you. I just bought my first car.
B: Great, congratulations! What kind of car is it?
A: It's a 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.
B: Oh, so it's an older make.
A: Yes, but it's in good condition. So, how much would the payments be?
B: Depends. Have you been in any accidents?
A: No, I have not.
B: Have you gotten any driving tickets?
A: Nope. That can affect the insurance rate?
B: At times. Well, everything seems in order. You would have to pay $75 monthly.
A: That sounds great.



A: Why were you absent yesterday?
B: Why do you care?
A: You should be thankful I care so much about your education.
B: The truth is, I didn't hear the alarm clock.
A: You missed out on a very important lecture.
B: It happens. I'll just ask my friend what was on the lecture.
A: Is she a good note taker?
B: I don't know. I guess?
A: If you were in class, you wouldn't have to rely on anyone's notes.
B: I can't change the past.
A: I know. Anyways, you should increase the volume on your alarm clock.
B: I suppose I could do that.



A: Is there a doctor on call?
B: What seems to be the problem?
A: My husband is having chest pain. I think it's a heart attack.
B: We are calling for an ambulance right now.
A: I don't need an ambulance, I need a doctor.
B: We don't have a doctor on duty at the hotel.
A: I think he is going to die!
B: The paramedics are on their way.
A: Is there no one on staff to help us?
B: Calm down, someone is coming up right now.
A: Someone is knocking on the door.
B: Take a deep breath; it may be the paramedics.



A: Do you have any news for me, Daniel?
B: Yes, sir. I do.
A: That's good to hear. It's been a while since I've heard from you.
B: We not have only one offer for your home, we have two.
A: Are they both serious offers?
B: Yes, sir, they are.
A: Okay, let's go over them.
B: The best one comes from the San Gabriel couple.
A: Why do you say that?
B: The offers are the same in dollars, but they placed no conditions on the sale.
A: Really? They will buy as it is?
B: Yes, sir, they will.
A: Okay. I think we found our buyer then.



A: I've run out of money for my iTunes!
B: You used it all up already?
A: I bought my favorite artists' albums today.
B: You must really like their music.
A: I do! There is no other like it.
B: Have you ever watched a live concert?
A: No, but I hope to, someday!
B: Until then, maybe you should refill your iTunes card.
A: I think I'll just use it all up again.
B: Then maybe you have all you need for now.
A: I'm going to look up her concerts on YouTube!
B: That's a better idea!



A: That was such a rush.
B: What did you do?
A: It was my first time voting in an election.
B: Oh wow! Congratulations, but why is that so exciting for you?
A: Are you kidding? I just played a role in history.
B: What if the incumbent wins?
A: Still, participating in U.S. democracy is great.
B: Maybe because I've done it so many times, and it doesn't seem like a big deal to me.
A: I can't wait to vote again next election.
B: Not everyone votes, so it's good that you take it seriously.
A: Everyone should take it seriously.
B: You're a great example.



A: What's your favorite movie?
B: "The Grand Budapest Hotel." Why do you ask?
A: I was wondering what types of movies you liked.
B: Well, that's my favorite movie, but I like all sorts of movies.
A: Oh, okay, but why do you like that movie so much?
B: Because it has action, adventure, comedy, and wonderful acting.
A: How many times would you say you have seen it?
B: Too many to say. I watch it at least twice a month.
A: Really, you like it that much?
B: It's a really good movie. You should watch it.
A: Could I borrow it? I don't have money to buy it.
B: Yes, I could lend you the movie, but be careful with it.



A: Your Honour, I'd like to challenge this ticket.
B: What is your reason for challenging this ticket?
A: The police officer did not have the right to issue the ticket.
B: Can you explain what you mean with that statement?
A: I was rightfully parked. He told me that I was parked in a handicap space.
B: Well, was it a handicap space?
A: It used to be. It is not anymore.
B: Well, was there a sign letting you know it was a handicap space?
A: No, because the spot has since been removed.
B: So, did you explain to the officer that it was no longer a handicap space.
A: I tried, but he wouldn't listen. He said I was trying to get away from paying.
B: Thank you. I will question the officer, and get his side of the story.



A: Thank you for coming so quickly.
B: What seems to be the problem?
A: All the channels suddenly stopped working.
B: Did you make sure all the cables are plugged in?
A: Yes, I checked and double checked them.
B: There may be some kind of signal interference.
A: Is there any way you can test that?
B: Of course! Give me a moment, please.
A: Do you know what the problem is?
B: Not quite yet. So you can't change the channels?
A: No, not at all.
B: Well, you'll be able to once you change the remote batteries.



A: Did you hear what happened to Marie?
B: I have no idea what happened. Is she okay?
A: She's devastated. Marie and her fiancé called the wedding off.
B: She was so excited about the wedding. How did you find out?
A: I saw Marie posting on Facebook; she was sad about losing her love.
B: What do you think happen?
A: I think Marie's fiancé is still in love with his ex.
B: What makes you say that?
A: Have you seen his Facebook page?
B: No. What does it say?
A: He has pictures of him and his so-called ex.
B: Wow, I feel so bad for Marie.



A: I'm here to have some blood tests done.
B: We take all the samples in the back room, so please follow me.
A: I usually have blood taken at the doctor's office.
B: More and more doctors are outsourcing that to private labs now.
A: It's kind of pain because I have to make another appointment to go somewhere else.
B: I understand, but we are professionals.
A: So you won't mind if I scream when you take blood?
B: Are you a screamer?
A: Sometimes I even faint.
B: I have a very gentle touch.
A: I'm going to close my eyes.
B: Well, first you need to fill out these forms.



A: I have so many places to go today.
B: Are you planning on taking the bus?
A: Yes. I'm going to have to bring so much bus fare with me.
B: You don't have to. Just buy a pass for the day.
A: A pass? What's that?
B: It comes in the form of a card that allows you to pass on any bus.
A: And is it just for one day?
B: You can buy a bus pass for the day, week, month, and even a year.
A: I didn't know that. How do I buy one?
B: You can ask for one on the bus.
A: How much does the card cost?
B: The card itself is one dollar, but a pass for the day is five.
A: I only need to bring six dollars with me today?
B: Yes. Unless you want to buy a pass for a week or longer.



A: Hello, neighbor. How are you today?
B: I'm fine. How are you?
A: I'm doing alright. I was wondering if I could ask you for a favor.
B: Sure. What is it?
A: I'll be away for the weekend. Could you take care of my dog?
B: Yeah, I'd love to. I'm great with dogs.
A: Oh, that's fantastic! Thank you very much!
B: Is there anything I need to know about your dog?
A: Not really. She's an old, calm, and friendly dog. You'll have no trouble.
B: Alright. I'll give you a call if I have any questions or concerns.
A: I'll bring her over in a few minutes along with her food. Thanks again!
B: No problem. Have a safe trip.



A: You really need a more balanced diet!
B: It's fine. I eat three times a day.
A: All three times and all you eat is fatty foods.
B: I'm not always eating junk food!
A: Not junk food, just fatty and oily food!
B: Try to eat equal amounts of meat and vegetables.
A: Why should I measure the portions that way?
B: You need to eat enough protein and vitamins!
A: Yeah, I'll take your advice.
B: You'll feel much healthier.
A: I believe you. Thanks for the advice!



A: Put your wet clothes into the dryer, please!
B: How long should I put them in for?
A: Put them on low heat for thirty minutes.
B: Why low heat?
A: If the air is too hot, the clothes will shrink.
B: I need to wash another load of laundry.
A: If they're colored, wash them in cold water.
B: Does warm water make them fade?
A: Yes. Put the detergent here, and don't use bleach.
B: Oh, that's where to put the detergent.
A: Don't forget to add fabric softener after the first rinse.
B: Okay, I won't. Thanks.



A: Hey, Richard, I could sure use your help.
B: What is it, Jerry?
A: I can't seem to land an interview.
B: Have you applied to many places?
A: Yes I have. I've sent out about 50 resumes.
B: Did you include cover letters?
A: On some I did, others, no.
B: Well, that may be your problem. You should always include a cover letter.
A: Really? Why?
B: It shows you took the time to research the company. HR people like that.
A: Okay, I will. Thanks.
B: You're welcome. I think you will see more interest in your resume now.



A: Hello, I would like to schedule an appointment to view the apartment.
B: Sure thing. What is your name?
A: My name is Lisa.
B: Okay, Lisa. I have an appointment available at three o'clock.
A: Three o'clock is just fine. On what day would that be?
B: I have days available from Saturday through Monday.
A: Can you do Friday instead?
B: No, I'm sorry. My son is visiting on Friday.
A: I understand. In that case, can I come the following day?
B: Saturday? that's great! See you then.



A: It's time to go sign the escrow papers.
B: I'm on my way. Give me a minute.
A: Okay, we have some time.
B: I'm really excited about this. This is our first home.
A: I know. I'm also excited.
B: I'm just glad we came to an agreement with the buyer.
A: Me too. That negotiation was rough.
B: But the realtor told me it was common.
A: That may be true, but I didn't expect it.
B: That doesn't matter now. We got the house.
A: I know! When can we start moving in?
B: Soon, I hope. Really soon.



A: We need to talk.
B: Uh oh! It sounds like you are going to break up with me or are pregnant.
A: Funny you should mention that.
B: Wait! You are pregnant?
A: No dummy. I think we need to take a break.
B: A break from what?
A: A break from seeing each other.
B: So, are you breaking up with me?
A: Yeah, I'm sorry. This just isn't working out.
B: Are you going to give me the "it's not you"?
A: No, because it actually is you.
B: At least you're honest.



A: Have you heard of the new burger place down the street?
B: Yes, I have. Have you tried it yet?
A: It's the bomb. The burgers are so good.
B: Is it expensive?
A: Not really. Not more than most places.
B: What do you like about it?
A: The food is great, and the waitresses bring you food on roller skates.
B: That's like those old-time drive-in places.
A: Yes, it is. Like in the 50s.
B: Wow, I got to go there soon.
A: I would highly recommend it.
B: Thanks. I'll definite go.



A: Can I please have a rum and coke?
B: You are going to have to wait until we take off and are at a cruising altitude.
A: I hate flying though, and I really need something to take the edge off.
B: I'm sorry we don't serve anything until after take-off.
A: I can pay you in cash.
B: We don't take cash on the plane anymore.
A: So how can I pay?
B: When I come around after we take off, you can pay with a debit or credit card.
A: I only have cash.
B: See if someone will buy you a drink then.
A: Can I smoke a cigarette to relax in the meantime?
B: Smoking isn't allowed on flights.



A: I would like to hire you to represent me in court.
B: What is the court case about?
A: I'm being accused of robbery.
B: Did you commit the robbery?
A: No! It was my twin brother.
B: Do you have proof of that?
A: I do have proof of that. I also have an airtight alibi.
B: When is the next court date?
A: I have to appear next week.
B: That doesn't give me much time to prepare.
A: I can pay whatever you ask.
B: In that case, let me have my secretary draw up a contract.



A: How much do I need to insert here to make one copy?
B: It depends. Do you want your copy in color or black and white?
A: I want it in color.
B: Then it will be 20 cents per page.
A: That's kind of expensive.
B: Yeah, but most of us don't have a copy machine of our own.
A: I have one, but it's broken.
B: That sucks. Well, if money's an issue, you can copy your stuff in black and white.
A: No, it has to be color.
B: Do you really not have 20 cents?
A: I do, but I'm really cheap.
B: Well, you don't really have a choice at this point.



A: Welcome to Infinity Insurance.
B: Hello. I am looking to buy insurance for my car.
A: Well, you have come to the right place. Please, sit.
B: I came in the other day, and I spoke with David.
A: Oh, great. Did he take down all your information?
B: Yes. He told me that I had to bring in this paper from the DMV.
A: Great. This should go by real quick, then.
B: David gave me a price yesterday, as well. He told me it would be $75.
A: Yes, that is what we charge for first time drivers.
B: Okay, I would like to make my first payment today.
A: Good. How would you be paying: cash, debit, or credit card?
B: I will be paying debit.



A: I'm having trouble connecting to the wireless network.
B: What network are you trying to connect to?
A: I'm trying to connect to the Bay Hotel Network.
B: You need to connect to Bay Hotel Guest Network.
A: What login do I use?
B: Your room number is your login.
A: What about the password?
B: The password for all guests is "vacationconnect", all one word, all lower case.
A: That seems to work. Thanks so much.
B: No problem. In the future, refer to the guest folder located by the television.
A: I'm so stupid. I didn't even think to look there.
B: No problem. That's what we're here for.



A: My dad told me he was going to put his second house in my name.
B: The one on Bronson Street?
A: Yes, that's the one.
B: Wow, that's a nice house.
A: Yes, it is. He wants me to start taking on more responsibilities.
B: Well, that will do it. It's not easy managing a home.
A: I guess not, but I won't be living in it now.
B: So what's he doing?
A: He's just doing a Quit Claim deed.
B: What's that?
A: It's just a deed transfer changing ownership of the home.
B: It's not a sale?
A: No. It's usually done between family members.



A: This is it. We can move in starting tomorrow.
B: No way! Really?
A: Yup. We cleared escrow. It's officially ours now.
B: I don't know what to say.
A: It's time to figure out how we're going to move in.
B: Well, I think we should rent a trailer, and move the big stuff first.
A: Yeah, that would make sense.
B: I'll start boxing everything else.
A: I know of a good moving company. My best friend used them last year.
B: Are they affordable?
A: I think so. I'll call them tomorrow morning.
B: I still can't believe that house is ours. It's a great feeling.



A: So, who did you vote for?
B: I voted for De Blasio.
A: It's been a while since New York City had a Democrat as a mayor.
B: It has been too long.
A: You think so? I'm a Republican.
B: It's like Obama's campaign. Change is good.
A: I guess we'll have to wait for the results.
B: That's true.
A: May the best person win.
B: I hope it was my candidate.
A: What if De Blasio doesn't win?
B: It's only four years till the next election.



A: Excuse me. Can I borrow your fabric softener?
B: Of course, take as much as you need.
A: Thank you. You're very kind.
B: It's no problem at all.
A: I love the subtle smell of this brand!
B: Me too! It's not overpowering or strong.
A: I think maybe I'll buy it for myself, too.
B: What I like about it is that it's hypoallergenic.
A: No kidding? That's really something.
B: It's perfect for washing delicate clothing.
A: Well, thank you for introducing me to this brand!
B: Anytime, no problem!



A: Do you have a favorite genre of music?
B: No, but I have favorite bands.
A: What bands would you consider your favorites?
B: The Beatles are the first. Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros are the second.
A: Is that all?
B: No, I really like The Clash. They are third.
A: I've only heard of The Beatles.
B: You should check out the other two bands. They are good.
A: Do you have any of their music that you could show me?
B: Sure, come over to my house after school, and I will show you their music.
A: Great! I've been looking for new music to listen to.
B: Don't worry; I will get you into a lot of new stuff.



A: I can't pay for the ticket.
B: Why can't you pay for the ticket?
A: Well, I just got laid off from my job.
B: Okay, Mr. Richardson. I'm going to give you an alternative.
A: What do you mean?
B: I am going to have to give you 36 hours of community service.
A: Thank you for the opportunity, Your Honor.
B: You will report to the nearest community service center.
A: They will tell me where to go?
B: Yes, they will give you an option of places to go.
A: Thank you, Your Honour. I greatly appreciate it.
B: You're welcome. I hope you don't plan on returning to this courtroom anytime soon.



A: I'd like to file a complaint.
B: Of course you want to file a complaint.
A: Are you the on-duty supervisor?
B: I am the on-duty supervisor.
A: Than you can take my complaint.
B: What is the nature of your complaint?
A: My neighbor is illegally dumping garbage in my yard.
B: Would you like us to send some officers to speak to him?
A: They already did that and he is still throwing nasty garbage in my yard.
B: All right, you're going to have to see the community police officer upstairs on the third floor.
A: They will take my complaint?
B: Yes, they will take it and conduct a full investigation.



A: I'm so sick of being sick.
B: Have you been taking any medicine?
A: I have taken every over-the-counter medicine in the pharmacy.
B: Maybe you need a prescription for an antibiotic.
A: I went to the doctor, and he says it's viral so no antibiotic will help.
B: Have you tried any home remedies?
A: What do you suggest?
B: You can try sitting in the bathroom with the shower running so it's all steamy.
A: What will that do?
B: It will help with the congestion.
A: Yeah, but I can't sit in the bathroom all day.
B: Do it in the morning and before you go to bed.



A: Hello, I would like to buy a bus pass.
B: Do you have a card to use for your pass?
A: What kind of card do I need?
B: It's a card I can provide you with.
A: Is it free to get?
B: No, but it's only one dollar.
A: It's nearly free. Here's the dollar.
B: Do you also have money for the day pass?
A: Yes, I do. How much is it for a day pass again?
B: Exactly five dollars.
A: I do have enough. Do I give you the money?
B: No, please deposit it into the machine.
A: Alright then. There you go.
B: Here's your pass for the day. Do take care of that.
A: Thank you very much. I'll hold on to it.
B: You're welcome. Have a nice day.



A: This is the first time I've ever had to do a timesheet.
B: Well, they're very easy to do.
A: You've done this before. Maybe you can help me.
B: Sure, I can help.
A: What do I need?
B: You'll need your employee number.
A: Okay, I'll look it up.
B: Once you have that, all you need to do is log your hours.
A: I have a good idea what hours I worked this week.
B: You need to be accurate.
A: It will be pretty close.
B: It must be exact. You don't want to cheat the company, or yourself.



A: I have to leave class early tomorrow.
B: I don't like that. Just don't come to class.
A: Don't be like that, Professor! I have to attend my mom's funeral.
B: I'm sorry for your loss.
A: It's okay. I'm going to miss her.
B: I lost my mom when I was in college, too.
A: Saddest thing ever, right?
B: Yes. You know what? Take a week off school.
A: I can't do that. I have too many responsibilities.
B: Take my advice.
A: I'll think about it.
B: If you ever need to talk, my door is open.



A: Are you my new neighbor?
B: Yes, I am. It's nice to meet you.
A: Nice to meet you, too.
B: How is your day going so far?
A: It's going just fine. Thank you for asking.
B: Do you think you can help me with something?
A: Sure, I would be glad to help, whatever I can.
B: It's nothing big. I just need help carrying my old couch to the curb.
A: Alright, do you want me to help you right now?
B: If it's not a problem.
A: No. I'll come over right now.
B: Thank you for the assistance.



A: Hi! Can I get a pizza slice, please?
B: Sure, is there anything else you'd like?
A: I'll also take that bag of chips.
B: What size drink would you like?
A: A medium soft drink, please.
B: Alright, you can go fill it at the fountain.
A: Can I also buy this banana, please?
B: Certainly. Will that be all?
A: Yes, that's all! What is my total?
B: Your total is $12.36.
A: Thank you! Have a nice day.
B: Thank you, you too.



A: Why is the printer line so long?
B: It's finals week.
A: Oh yeah, you're right.
B: This happens every year, so I got smarter.
A: What do you mean?
B: I printed my stuff for finals at home.
A: Oh, that is smart. I have to get in line now.
B: What do you have to print?
A: I have to print some notes.
B: Good luck. You'll be waiting here for a long time.
A: I bet the ink and paper will go out.
B: If that happens, you're in trouble.



A: I'm having trouble with my personal statement. 
B: You should go to the personal statement workshop.
A: What is that?
B: It's where a professional will give you tips and revise your personal statement.
A: That sounds helpful.
B: It is. I went to one last week.
A: How was it?
B: The person leading the workshop was an English professor, so it was informative.
A: I'm kind of embarrassed to show my personal statement, though.
B: You shouldn't be.
A: I feel like I'll be laughed at.
B: The workshop will improve your writing. You really should go.



A: Can you record the new episode of Clarence for me?
B: Why don't you watch it yourself?
A: I won't be home that day and my Internet is down.
B: Okay, I'll record it since I know it's your favorite show.
A: Thank you in advance!
B: It may be a good chance to watch it myself, actually.
A: I really recommend it! It's cute and funny.
B: Have you watched the shows I recommended to you?
A: No, but I will once my Internet works again.
B: We can have a day that we get together to watch TV shows.
A: That sounds like a lot of fun!
B: It's a plan, then!



A: Excuse me. I would like to return this.
B: What seems to be the problem?
A: It's not working correctly.
B: When did it start having problems?
A: As soon as I took it out of the box.
B: I see. Would you like to exchange it?
A: No, I think I'd just like my money back.
B: Alright. Did you pay with a credit card?
A: Yes, I paid with the store credit card.
B: I'll return the purchase price to your card.
A: Can I get any cash in return?
B: No. You now have store credit in your card.



A: Good afternoon. Are you the person renting out the apartment?
B: Yes, I am. What can I do for you?
A: I'm interested in viewing the apartment.
B: Alright, would like to make an appointment?
A: Yes, I very much would.
B: What time are you available?
A: Mostly after sundown on weekdays. What days are good for you?
B: I work in the evenings Monday through Friday. Are you available at any time on the weekends?
A: I'm available on Sunday. How about three o'clock Sunday afternoon? 
B: That's a perfect time for me.
A: Great! I'll come over at three on Sunday.
B: Sure! I'm expecting you.



A: I just came back from eating at the new steak place.
B: Oh, I've been wanting to go there. How was it?
A: Don't bother going.
B: Really? Why?
A: It was terrible. The food was cold, and the service sucked.
B: Oh, no. I was looking forward to trying it out.
A: Like I said, don't bother.
B: I mean, how bad was the food?
A: It was awful. They got my order wrong, and it was cold.
B: Well, maybe it was just an isolated incident.
A: I don't think so. I spoke to other diners, and they were disappointed, too.
B: I guess that means I have to find another place.



A: Do you hate flying as much as I do?
B: Only when I have chatty seatmates.
A: You look like a business traveler, am I right?
B: I'm in sales, but please excuse me. I have a lot of work to do.
A: Is that computer connected to the airplane wi-fi network?
B: It is, so I can send work to my office even when travelling.
A: I hope they pay you really well.
B: That's really none of your business.
A: Do you have a company credit card?
B: I do because I travel so much.
A: Maybe you can buy me a drink since all I have is cash.
B: I can only pay for business expenses, not alcohol.



A: I always get so emotional at weddings.
B: Me too, especially when I see the bride and groom kiss.
A: The bride looked so beautiful.
B: She did, and the groom looked so dapper in his tux.
A: I'll see you at the reception in a little bit.
B: No, you won't, because I wasn't invited.
A: Oh, I'm so sorry. Maybe your invite was lost in the mail.
B: It's okay. Why don't you bring me as your plus one?
A: Actually no, because I'm going with my husband.
B: Please take pictures so I can see how nice everyone looked.
A: I'm sure there will be pictures online afterwards.
B: It's not the same as being there.



A: So what are you ordering?
B: I'm not sure. I like their burgers.
A: Yeah, me too. Have you tried their fish sandwich?
B: Yuck. Yes, I have. I didn't like it.
A: Really? Why not?
B: It was too greasy. I think I'll get the No. 2 instead.
A: What's that?
B: That's their bacon burger special.
A: Is it good?
B: It's very tasty. They use thick bacon.
A: Oh, good. Other places use paper-thin bacon.
B: I think I like think bacon better.



A: What a great day to be at the beach.
B: I love the smell of the salt-water air.
A: Are you going to go swimming in that water?
B: You bet. I'm going into the ocean.
A: I actually hate swimming in the ocean.
B: Why do you like the beach then?
A: I like people watching.
B: Do you like doing that at the pool?
A: Yes, but when I go to the pool, I actually swim.
B: So I guess you won't go surfing with me.
A: Nope, but I'll cheer for you from my beach towel.
B: I'd rather do something together like making a sand castle.



A: Can you please shut up?
B: Maybe if you ask nicely, I will!
A: This is a library, so you have to shut up.
B: I didn't know laughing was a crime.
A: It's a crime in the library.
B: You're just jealous, because I'm having a good time, and you're not.
A: No, that's not it at all.
B: I'll shut up if you say you're sorry.
A: Sorry for what? If anything, you should say sorry.
B: Okay, fine. I'm sorry that your parents didn't teach you how to be nice.
A: That does it. I'm getting a librarian.
B: Go get one!



A: Have you ever been to the opera before?
B: No, but I hear it's very beautiful.
A: Is it true that opera is sung in a foreign language?
B: Yes, usually in Italian or French.
A: How are we supposed to know what's going on?
B: The actors also tell the story with their actions.
A: It seems a bit confusing to me.
B: The music is supposed to be beautiful, regardless.
A: Are they accompanied by an orchestra?
B: Yes, a very large one with talented performers.
A: I suppose the music will tell a story, too.
B: Yes. Music is a universal language.



A: I would like to buy this new laptop, please.
B: Would you like to buy the warranty?
A: What is a warranty?
B: It's something that fixes your machine should it break.
A: How does it work?
B: If your laptop breaks, just bring it in and we'll fix it.
A: How much is the laptop?
B: It costs $550 without tax.
A: How much is the warranty?
B: The warranty is $40 for two years.
A: I think I'll be fine with just the laptop.
B: Alright, but you can always change your mind.



A: I'm really bummed that Di Blasio won the election.
B: Really? Why is that?
A: I think Republican mayors have been good for our city.
B: There's too much inequality.
A: You think this new mayor will change that?
B: You bet he will. It was his campaign promise.
A: Politicians make promises all the time. It doesn't mean anything.
B: I think you're wrong.
A: Mark my words. This will mean more crime.
B: Crime has been going down all over the country.
A: Thanks to the Democrats.
B: I guess we'll have to give the new mayor a chance.



A: I have never bought a bus pass before. Do you know how?
B: Yes I do. You can buy it from the bus driver.
A: What kinds of bus passes do they have?
B: They have day passes, week passes, and month passes.
A: How much is the monthly pass?
B: It's 64 dollars, but if you're a student, you can get it for 35 dollars.
A: Yes. I'm a student. I think I'll get the monthly pass.
B: Since you'll be getting the student discount, you need to show your student I.D.
A: Alright. Thank you for your help.
B: No problem. Anytime!



A: I would like to see my counselor now.
B: Sorry, she doesn't have any time today.
A: Are you serious?
B: Yes, I am. Please make an appointment for next week.
A: I really need to see her.
B: I'm sorry, but you really can't.
A: I swear, I will bang on her door and scream.
B: Don't make a scene.
A: If you don't want me to make a scene, tell the counselor I'm here.
B: Fine! You can only talk to her for five minutes, though.
A: That's all I need.
B: Next time, you'd better make an appointment.



A: I need to make an appointment to see Dr. Taylor.
B: Are you already a patient of Dr. Taylor?
A: No, this is the first time I've been seeing him.
B: What kind of appointment is this?
A: It's for my annual physical.
B: Can you tell me what insurance you have?
A: I have Blue Cross.
B: The earliest appointment I can give you is Wednesday, September 3 at 10 in the morning.
A: That works for me.
B: Please bring in your health insurance cards when you come in on that day.
A: Will you send me a reminder in the mail?
B: If you give us your phone number, we will remind you the day before.



A: Hi! How are you?
B: I'm doing good. How are you?
A: I'm great, but a little nervous.
B: Why is that?
A: I have a phone interview for a job in an hour.
B: A phone interview? That's great!
A: It is, but I'm convinced I'm going to mess it up.
B: Oh, you shouldn't say that. You'll be fine.
A: I wish I had your confidence.
B: Just relax, and be yourself. A phone interview is easier than in person.
A: That's right. I wasn't looking at it that way.
B: Be yourself. Don't pretend to be anyone else, and you'll do well.



A: It's a nice apartment.
B: I knew you would like it. Who wouldn't?
A: There is only one issue.
B: What is it? Is it the next door neighbor?
A: No, he's great. I was talking about the price.
B: What about the price? It's a fair price, if I do say so myself.
A: I think it's a little too high for me. Is there anything you can do for me?
B: I'm not sure if I can.
A: Listen, I would be the perfect tenant.
B: And how is that?
A: Well, I always make my payments on time. You can check my credit score.
B: Alright, that's good to hear.
A: I sleep early, and am very respectable. I also have no pets.
B: I think I've heard enough. You sound like a good tenant. I'm going to reduce the monthly rent by $100.



A: What's wrong? You look sad.
B: I was rejected from my dream school.
A: I'm sorry to hear that.
B: I feel so stupid. What's wrong with me?
A: Nothing. If your dream school doesn't want you, then that's their loss.
B: I don't know what to do anymore.
A: Look, that school didn't accept you, because you weren't the right fit.
B: Is that supposed to make me feel better?
A: I'm just saying, why would you want to go to a school that doesn't fit you?
B: When you say it like that, I understand you.
A: Yeah! Just focus on the schools that do want you.
B: You're right! Yale made a mistake rejecting me.



A: Where do I go to get my food?
B: Just walk around and pick what you want.
A: I'll take a sandwich and a pear.
B: I think I'll have the same.
A: What are you getting to drink?
B: I'll just have water.
A: Where do we pay for all of this?
B: Carry your tray to the cash register.
A: This reminds me of the school lunch line.
B: Well, it does work the same way.
A: Don't forget to grab napkins!
B: Thanks for reminding me!



A: Can I get you something to eat or drink?
B: I'd like a coffee and a breakfast sandwich.
A: The coffee is complimentary, but the sandwich costs five dollars.
B: So much for a measly sandwich?!
A: Will that be all for you?
B: For now, but if I'm hungry or thirsty later, can I have something else?
A: As long as it's before we land.
B: What else can I have to eat or drink?
A: There is a menu in your seatback pocket.
B: How do I get your attention when I'm ready to order something else?
A: Just press the button above your head with the image of a person.
B: Can I have a copy of my receipt?



A: So, how much is the ticket going to cost?
B: Well, it's going to be $200.
A: $200 for a parking ticket?
B: Well, it looks like this is your third parking ticket.
A: Yes, but I haven't gotten one in a couple of months.
B: This is your third parking ticket this year.
A: I know. Fine, I will pay the ticket.
B: How will you be paying the ticket?
A: I will be paying cash.
B: So that'll be $200 in cash.
A: Yes. Let me get you your receipt.
B: Thank you. Have a nice day.


A: Honey, where are the kitchen utensils?
B: I have no idea, Alicia. They're in one of these boxes.
A: I can't believe how much work is involved in moving out.
B: I didn't expect this, either.
A: I hope this is the last time we move in a while.
B: Me, too. I thought it was just a matter of calling a moving company, but wow!
A: That's just the beginning. Everything has to be organized, and packed first.
B: It's a good thing the kids are helping.
A: Yes, and your brother, too. His truck has made this easier.
B: We've stayed in this house for a long time.
A: Yes. It's time to move, but I don't want to go through this again.
B: We won't, Alicia. Remember, we got the house we wanted.



A: I need someone to come up and restock the minibar in my room.
B: Does everything need to be restocked?
A: The good stuff needs to be restocked.
B: Tell me what's good to you, sir.
A: The three mini bottles of Grey Goose were great.
B: Do you need the mixers to be restocked, too?
A: I just need more cranberry juice to go with the vodka.
B: Do any of the snacks need to be restocked?
A: Bring a can of the honey roasted nuts.
B: You like nuts, sir?
A: I'm nuts about nuts.
B: Okay, just give me your room number and someone will restock those items.



A: Do you know who won against the Dodgers and the Cubs?
B: I'm sorry, but I don't follow baseball.
A: Oh, really? Why not?
B: I've never really got into baseball. I like basketball better.
A: Oh, okay. Do you have a cell phone?
B: Yes, why do you ask?
A: Could you check to see who won the baseball game?
B: Sure, let me check. It'll take one minute. It looks like the Chicago Cubs won seven to three.
A: Yes! I was rooting for the Cubs.
B: Well, they won. Glad I could be of some service.
A: Thanks again. Have a nice day.



A: I have a question about my one-room apartment.
B: What do you need to know?
A: Am I allowed to have extra people living with me?
B: You are only allowed one roommate, but they'll need to have an application on file.
A: Will I be charged extra for any additional people?
B: Yes. And you'll also need special permission for that.
A: Are my visitors allowed to use any of the facilities?
B: Yes, but you have to be present with them.
A: Are occasional guest sleepovers fine?
B: As long as it is occasional, it should be no problem.
A: Thank you. That is all I needed to know.
B: Alright. If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask.



A: Hello, is this the Smith residence?
A: Sarah! Hurry up and get out of bed!
B: I can't, the blankets won't let me go.
A: Quit being lazy and get up!
B: No, I have to finish my awesome dream!
A: I can't believe you turned off your alarm this morning.
B: Why? I do it every morning.
A: If you don't get out of bed, you'll get to school late.
B: That's not so bad.
A: How is it not so bad?
B: Sleep is good for growing children.
A: Yes, but you have a math test this morning!
B: I completely forgot! I'm up, I'm up!



A: Can you tell me where the pool is?
B: It's right outside the automatic sliding doors to your left.
A: Is it open 24 hours?
B: No. The pool is open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.
A: Where can I get towels for the pool?
B: There are wicker baskets by the pool with fresh towels.
A: Is the pool heated?
B: We keep the pool heated to 80 degrees.
A: How deep is the pool?
B: The pool is 3 feet on one end and goes up to 12 feet at the other end.
A: How often do they clean the pool?
B: It's cleaned every day before it opens.



A: Your blood pressure is very high.
B: What does high blood pressure mean?
A: High blood pressure or hypertension means that there is a lot of pressure on your arteries.
B: That doesn't sound very good.
A: It isn't very good because it means you are at higher risk to develop heart disease.
B: I feel fine, though.
A: High blood pressure is called a silent killer.
B: What causes high blood pressure?
A: It could be the sign of some other diseases.
B: I am already taking medication.
A: You should tell me the medications you are taking because some meds cause high blood pressure.
B: I'd better change my lifestyle.



A: Hello. I need to make an appointment.
B: Were you mandated by the court to go to traffic school?
A: Yes, I was. Does that matter?
B: Yes, it does. Let me have your full name.
A: It's David Johnson. What days do you have available?
B: We have Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
A: Oh, okay. I can make it on Thursday. What time should I be in?
B: Come in at 9 a.m. if you can't make it during that time, please call.
A: Great. I will see you this Thursday.
B: Remember to bring your court papers. We will need to sign those.
A: I seem to have lost them. Could I go to court to get another copy?
B: Yes, go to the court and print them out before you come over.



A: I have decided not to transfer.
B: Why not? You kept saying you wanted to.
A: I know, but it's so hard getting accustomed to a new school.
B: That's a terrible reason not to transfer.
A: No, it's a good one. I feel at home here.
B: Sometimes, a new environment is necessary.
A: No, I really like it here. Also, I know what to expect.
B: I still think you're making the wrong choice. 
A: Why do you want me to go?
B: I just think this school isn't right for you.
A: That's not for you to decide.
B: I know, but I'm just stating my opinion.



A: Finally we'll have a Democratic mayor in New York City.
B: I don't even know what that is like.
A: Exactly! There hasn't been a Democrat running this city in a long time.
B: I hope he will live up to all his campaign promises.
A: He will. The mayor elect is really sincere.
B: They all seem sincere in the beginning.
A: This is really going to turn the city around.
B: How will that happen?
A: Are your kidding? There will be better schools.
B: The school system is pretty bad right now.
A: There will also be more affordable housing.
B: The city sure could use that.



A: I missed my connecting flight to Washington D.C.
B: How did you miss your flight?
A: I was sitting in the airport bar and I lost track of time.
B: Well, that's not really our fault.
A: Fine, but what can you do for me?
B: I can put you on the stand-by list.
A: What does that mean?
B: It means that if there are empty seats on the next flight out, you can get on.
A: What if there are no seats?
B: You can buy another ticket.
A: I didn't even buy the first ticket.
B: I guess you have to buy a ticket.



A: Does this bus stop at Normandy Street?
B: Yes, it does. Is that your stop?
A: Yes, it is. How much further until the bus gets there?
B: Actually, the bus passed by Normandy Street ten minutes ago.
A: I missed my bus stop? Darn it, I knew this would happen to me.
B: Are you on your way to work?
A: Fortunately I'm not, or else I would've been running late.
B: Are you meeting a friend?
A: Yes, I am actually. I'm going to have to call him, and tell him I missed my stop.
B: You should get off on the upcoming stop.
A: Good idea. I'll just walk back to Normandy.
B: It might be a long walk.



A: I think the movers are here, Brian.
B: They're here? They are early.
A: Yes, I know. They're an hour early.
B: We're not ready yet. I'll tell them to come back.
A: No, that's okay, dear. I'll go talk to them.
B: Are you sure?
A: Yes, they can start loading the furniture while we pack the small stuff.
B: I guess that's okay.
A: We'll be fine. Most of the furniture is in the front anyway.
B: As long as they don't get in our way.
A: I'll tell them we're not done packing. It should be okay.
B: It'd better be. They're very early.



A: Is there anything I can say or do to make you lower the monthly rent?
B: I doubt it, but let me hear you out.
A: If you lower the price, I will mow the lawn and trim the hedges every month.
B: No, I already have someone who does that.
A: What if I give you the first two months' rent in advance?
B: No deal. Sorry, kid.
A: Looks like I can't convince you to lower the rent.
B: I'm sorry, but that was a good effort.
A: I guess I'm going to have such a hard time paying rent.
B: Don't look so down now.
A: I can't help it.
B: Alright, you win! I'll lower the price.



A: Hello, is this Mr. Smith? I'm Mrs. Jones.
B: Hello, Mrs. Jones. Did you get my message?
A: Yes, I did, I'm returning your call.
B: Oh, right, of course.
A: What's the problem? Is James in trouble?
B: I caught him copying a classmate's test today.
A: Oh, that child is incorrigible!
B: I'm afraid I'll have to give him detention this time.
A: It's alright, I understand.
B: James certainly is strong-willed.
A: Yes, he needs a firm hand and discipline!
B: He's a good boy. Now if only he'd stop cheating!



A: Good morning, Jet Office Products.
B: Hello, my name is Richard Lee, and I would like to make an appointment.
A: Good morning, Mr. Lee. My name is Sheila.
B: Hello, Sheila. I was asked by Mrs. Roberts to schedule a meeting with her.
A: Is this for an interview?
B: No, I've already interviewed with her.
A: Oh, I see. It's for a follow-up meeting. When are you free?
B: My schedule is fairly open. When will she be available?
A: How about Tuesday at 9 a.m.?
B: This Tuesday, the 5th?
A: Yes, that's correct.
B: That will be fine. I'll be there. Thanks.



A: My baseball game starts at 2 p.m. today. Will you be there?
B: Yes, I will definitely be there.
A: Great! I will tell my family to save you a seat.
B: What position will you be playing?
A: I will be playing first base, but the coach may switch me.
B: If he switches you, what position will you play?
A: I think he wants me to pitch.
B: You are a pitcher as well?
A: Yes, I am. I'm still training, but I can throw.
B: I didn't know that about you.
A: Well, hopefully you can see me pitch today.
B: Awesome! I can't wait.



A: I'm glad you came to talk to me today.
B: You kind of forced me to.
A: That's because I'm worried.
B: What are you worried about?
A: You withdrew from 4 of your 5 classes last semester.
B: I was doing poorly!
A: And why was that exactly?
B: It was just too hard.
A: You're really behind now. You might have to spend 6 years here.
B: Can't I just take summer classes?
A: Yes, but you don't want to stress yourself out.
B: I don't really have a choice.



A: Do you have a restroom?
B: Only for employees.
A: But I really need to go.
B: I can't let you go. There's a restroom in the market across from us though.
A: That restroom is really dirty. It smells like someone died in there.
B: Fine, I'll take you to our restroom.
A: Yay! Thank you so much.
B: We have to go secretly. If anyone sees you use the restroom, I'll be fired.
A: Don't worry. I will be small and quiet as a mouse.
B: Okay, good. The password is 595. Go quickly before anyone sees you.
A: Thank you for your kindness.
B: You owe me if we ever see each other again.



A: What are you carrying?
B: It's a newspaper with coupons.
A: Why do you keep looking at it?
B: I'm buying the fruit that is not on sale at Ralphs.
A: Is it on sale here?
B: No, but it's a bit cheaper.
A: Why is it cheaper?
B: It's a town supermarket, not a big chain.
A: Look! Milk prices rose.
B: Lucky for me. I have a coupon for Super Foods.
A: I have to start couponing, too.
B: You sure save a lot of money!



A: Hi, I need assistance, please.
B: How can I help you today?
A: My phone refuses to turn on anymore.
B: It looks like it short circuited.
A: Well, I did drop it many times.
B: I'm afraid I can't help you.
A: I guess I'll have to use the warranty.
B: According to your contract, you may choose a new phone.
A: I'll just get the same brand again.
B: Will you need the warranty?
A: No. Just have the phone.
B: Make sure you don't go dropping it!



A: Come inside my apartment! Make yourself feel at home.
B: Thank you for letting me visit you today.
A: It's always nice to meet extra tenants of the apartment.
B: How do you like the apartment so far?
A: I don't like it, I love it!
B: I'm glad to hear that.
A: Everybody I've met is super friendly, and the apartment is beautiful.
B: I share the exact same thoughts.
A: How long have you been a tenant here?
B: Not long. I moved in a few months ago.
A: Would you like a drink?
B: Sure, I'm kind of thirsty.



A: I got accepted to all of the schools I applied to.
B: Congrats! You totally deserve it.
A: How many schools did you apply to?
B: I applied to six.
A: What was your first reaction when you got into your dream school?
B: I was shocked. My heart stopped.
A: I know the feeling. It's a great one.
B: It is. I don't even know what school to pick now. 
A: Same here. Who knew getting accepted would have problems?
B: It's a good problem!
A: Hey, we should visit schools together.
B: That would be fun!



A: I'm thinking of adding another class.
B: Another one? You already have 7 classes.
A: I know, but I really want to add Psychology 101. It seems interesting.
B: You're going to be so stressed out.
A: I think I can handle 8 classes.
B: Seriously? You're going to be constantly in class or studying.
A: I know, but it's worth it.
B: Tell me that when I'm partying and you're not.
A: How many classes are you taking? Two?
B: Haha! You're funny. I'm taking three.
A: That's so little. Don't you feel like an underachiever?
B: Remind me again why we're friends.



A: I can't find the jasmine rice!
B: Isn't it in the rice section?
A: No, they don't have it here.
B: Let's check again. Is it this one?
A: No, that's short grain white rice.
B: What about this one? It's longer.
A: No, that's brown rice.
B: How are we supposed to find jasmine rice?
A: Oh, I see more rice in another isle.
B: I found it in the international section.
A: I find it funny that Americans think this rice is exotic!
B: Me, too! But Americans call everything different exotic.



A: Having a new president will change the course of history.
B: Why do you say that?
A: Well, Obama was our first black president. Now we have our first woman.
B: You think gender matters that much?
A: Absolutely! Women view things differently.
B: You don't think she'll be too soft on foreign policy?
A: No way! Look how she handled things as Secretary of State.
B: That's true. She was tough, but also sympathetic.
A: Exactly. We need someone who is more than just tough.
B: I worry about people being too tough on her.
A: She was a first lady so she knows the ins and outs.
B: She definitely has experience.



A: I need a cab to the theater district.
B: We can get that for you right away.
A: Well, I don't need to be there for another hour.
B: Would you like to reserve a limo then?
A: That seems a bit much for me. Just a regular cab is fine.
B: We can't reserve a taxi that far in advance, sir.
A: So how do I get a cab in an hour then?
B: If you go right outside our lobby when you are ready, a staff member will hail one for you.
A: Do I have to tip the guy who gets the cab for me?
B: Tips aren't mandatory, but they are appreciated.
A: Maybe I'll just hail the cab myself then.
B: That's also an option.



A: I think I'm ready to sign the lease.
B: Good! Let me just go over some key points.
A: If you feel the need to do so, then go ahead.
B: By signing this contract, you are agreeing to rent the apartment for a certain amount of time.
A: Yes, I am aware of this. The lease is for one year.
B: Are you ready to make that commitment?
A: Yes, I am. What else?
B: No pets in the apartment.
A: Don't worry. I have no pets.
B: There'll be a late fee of $20 if you don't pay on time.
A: I have no problem with that. Where do I sign?
B: Write your signature here, and your initials here and here.



A: I need to get into downtown as quickly as possible.
B: We have many ground transportation options.
A: I don't want to have to share a car with anyone.
B: Then a taxi would probably be the best option.
A: Where can I get a taxi?
B: There is a special taxi line right outside the revolving doors.
A: How much is that going to cost me?
B: The city taxis have a meter so you pay by the mile.
A: Does the fare include the tip?
B: No, How much you tip is up to you.
A: Does the taxi take credit cards?
B: No. Taxis here are cash only.



A: Are you locked out of your apartment?
B: It appears that I am.
A: Did you forget your key inside your apartment?
B: No. I think I lost it somewhere in the city.
A: That's unfortunate. I think I could help you.
B: Really? Do you have another key?
A: No, but the landlord does.
B: He doesn't live here though.
A: I have his phone number. I'll just give him a call.
B: Thank you. If you want, I'll talk to him myself.
A: No, don't worry. I talk to him for you.
B: Please I insist. I should be the one to ask for help since I'm the one who's in need of it.
A: Alright, suit yourself.



A: Hello, Mr. Smith. It's nice to finally meet you.
B: Likewise, Mrs. Jones. Please sit down.
A: Is James in trouble again?
B: Actually, no, he's not.
A: What's the purpose of this meeting exactly?
B: I just wanted to let you know that James is doing very well.
A: Oh, is that right? I'm so proud!
B: He has been staying for tutoring and his marks have skyrocketed!
A: I always knew he had it in him!
B: He behaves better in the classroom, too.
A: I do believe my James is growing up!
B: All children need to mature is motivation!



A: Look! The bus is coming!
B: Let's see if we can cross the street in time to catch it.
A: I don't think we are going to make it.
B: You are right. There it goes.
A: When will the next bus arrive?
B: According to the bus stop pamphlet, it should arrive in about fifteen minutes.
A: We are going to be a bit late.
B: I hope our friends don't get impatient.
A: Hopefully they'll understand.
B: It should be here any moment now.
A: Look! Here it comes!
B: Get your bus pass ready to hop on board!



A: Wow, you really look terrible.
B: Thanks a lot. I really feel awful.
A: I'm a nurse ,so you should tell me your symptoms.
B: Well, to begin with, my whole body aches.
A: Have you taken your temperature to see if you have a fever?
B: I have, and I'm running a slight fever.
A: Sounds like you may have the flu.
B: That's impossible because I got my flu shot.
A: You can still get the flu even if you get vaccinated.
B: Well, that makes getting the vaccine pointless.
A: Not really, because you will probably get over it quickly.
B: I'm going to make some tea and lie down.



A: Good afternoon. Jet Office Products.
B: Hello, my name is Richard Lee. I need to reschedule an appointment.
A: I could help you with that.
B: I have an appointment for 9 a.m. Tuesday that I need to change.
A: Who was your appointment with?
B: I was scheduled to see Mrs. Roberts.
A: Okay. Thank you for calling.
B: You're welcome. Can I reschedule?
A: Yes, of course. When will you be free?
B: Does Mrs. Roberts have any time on Wednesday?
A: No, but she's free Thursday afternoon at 1:00 p.m.
B: That's perfect. Thank you. I'll see her then.



A: Can you explain baseball to me?
B: I can try to explain the basics. What do you want to know?
A: What are strikes?
B: Every batter has three strikes. When they get three strikes, they are out.
A: Okay, but what about when the umpire calls a ball?
B: Once an umpire calls four balls, then the batter goes to first base.
A: What happens when a pitcher hits a batter with the ball?
B: The batter goes to first base.
A: What if someone is on first base?
B: Then whoever was on first base goes to second base.
A: Oh, okay. What's a no-hitter?
B: A no-hitter is when a team doesn't get a hit throughout the game.
A: So, that's a good thing for the pitcher?
B: Yes, because that means he pitched really well.



A: Thank you for coming in today. I'll see you next week.
B: Excuse me, instructor. May I speak with you for a moment?
A: Sure thing, Mr. Davis. What can I help you with?
B: Well, about next week. I can't make it.
A: That is a problem. You are mandated by court to attend every week.
B: I know, but I have a family emergency.
A: You have to go to the court and ask for an extension.
B: Do I have to come back over here after?
A: No, they will give you a make-up date.
B: Great. Thank you for all your help.
A: Sure thing. I hope everything is alright.
B: Thanks. I'll see you next time.



A: You should volunteer at the library with me!
B: What's so good about volunteering there?
A: It's fun, and you feel good about yourself.
B: What do you do there?
A: Everyone does different things. I organize events.
B: What kind of events?
A: Movies, art and crafts, magic shows, and more.
B: That does sound fun!
A: Do you want to sign up?
B: Yeah, how do I sign up?
A: I'll get you an application.



A: Excuse me; I'd like to use the warranty on my phone.
B: What do you mean use the warranty?
A: The warranty promises a new phone if this one breaks.
B: Did something happen to it?
A: I dropped it and the screen cracked very badly.
B: It says here that your warranty has expired.
A: What! That can't be true!
B: I'm afraid it was only good for a year, sir.
A: What am I supposed to do with a busted phone?
B: Well, if you trade it in, you'll get a discount.
A: Well, I suppose it won't hurt.
B: I suggest you buy a longer warranty on this one, sir.



A: What's going on? What happened?
B: I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention.
A: Well, I'm going to need your information.
B: Yes, I know. I'm sorry. I was distracted with the car accident.
A: I figured. Well, here is my information.
B: Let me get my information. I have it in my car.
A: Yes, please do that.
B: Well, it seems like I don't have my insurance card.
A: How could you not have your insurance information?
B: I drive another car; I must have left it in that one.
A: Fine. Let me get your information.
B: Sure, call me later on today. I will give you my information.



A: You need to try harder in school!
B: I am doing well in school.
A: Then why are your marks in science so low?
B: I don't understand science, that's all.
A: Is that the same reasoning you have for math?
B: Yes, and English, too.
A: Tell me one single subject you're doing well in.
B: Well, I'm doing wonderfully in my music class.
A: What about history?
B: Only the parts about Woodstock.
A: That's it! You're grounded! No guitar for a month.
B: Great, now I'll surely have a low GPA.



A: Where can I get a tour of the city?
B: We can arrange a tour for you right here at our concierge desk.
A: How much is the tour?
B: It depends on what kind of tour you want.
A: I hear you have a half-day bus tour.
B: We do, and it is $25 per person.
A: Can I get off the bus and explore on my own?
B: You can only do that if you take the all-day bus tour.
A: Is that more money?
B: It doubles the price.
A: That's highway robbery, but book me anyway.
B: That will be $50 then.



A: I'm ready to check out.
B: Give me your room key, and tell me your room number, please?
A: Here's the key. I was in room 250.
B: Let me print out a copy of all your charges for your review.
A: This looks right.
B: Excellent! Will you be paying with the credit card you used when you checked in?
A: Yeah, just charge the total to that.
B: I just need your signature and you're all set.
A: Thanks so much. I had a wonderful stay.
B: I hope you will stay with us again in the future.
A: I stay here all the time when I'm in town on business.
B: In that case, we'll see you soon.



A: Wow, this place is amazing.
B: Is this your first time here?
A: It's my first day at this school. I just transferred.
B: I see. You're going to love it here.
A: I think I will too.
B: Did you move in yet?
A: Yes, I have an apartment nearby.
B: That's good. What's your first class?
A: My very first class is human biology.
B: I hope it's educational and entertaining.
A: I think it will be. 
B: I'll walk you there, since you probably don't know where anything is.



A: Good morning, Peterson Industries.
B: Hello, Betty. This is Roger.
A: Hey, Roger. Where are you?
B: I am stuck on the 60 freeway. I'm going to be late for work.
A: Oh, no. Any traffic accident happened?
B: I really don't know, Betty. All I know is that traffic is crawling.
A: I will tell your supervisor you called in late.
B: That would be great, but I could tell him myself.
A: Well, normally that would be okay, but he's stuck in the same traffic jam.
B: Oh no! Really? Okay.
A: At least he'll know your excuse is true!
B: Yes. Thank you. See you soon.



A: Would you like to go see a movie tomorrow night?
B: I am busy tomorrow night, but I am free the night after.
A: That's great! What time should I pick you up?
B: 8 p.m. would be great.
A: Well, 8 p.m. it is. What movie would you like to see?
B: I'm not sure. Which movies are out right now?
A: I actually don't know. How about we choose when we get there?
B: Sure thing, that sounds great.
A: Okay, should I pick you up at your house? Or do you want to meet somewhere?
B: I live by school; if you want, we could meet there.
A: Sure. I drive a white Nissan Sentra. I'll text you later on, okay?
B: That sounds great. I'll be waiting for your text.



A: Help, please. My key won't open the front door to my apartment.
B: Oh, no. Let me try to help you.
A: Thank you, but I don't think there's much you can do.
B: Don't be so pessimistic. I'll help you unlock that door.
A: I already tried using the key. There's no use in trying anymore.
B: I have another idea. Care to hear it?
A: Alright, I don't have any other options.
B: Let me drive you to a locksmith.
A: What good will that do?
B: A locksmith can replace your key. The one you have now is probably broken.
A: It's worth a try, I guess.
B: There's the spirit! Come on, let's go.



A: I don't recognize any of these streets.
B: Is this your first time riding this bus?
A: No, I take this bus to school every day.
B: This bus always drives by these streets.
A: Are you sure this is not just a new route.
B: I'm pretty sure it's not.
A: Perhaps it could be a detour.
B: Perhaps you might be on the wrong bus.
A: There's no way this is the wrong bus.
B: If you don't believe me, maybe you should go ask the bus driver.
A: Wait, I don't think I have to. You're right, this is the wrong bus.
B: I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so.
A: How could I make such a dumb mistake?
B: You should get off on the next stop.



A: What brings you in to see me today?
B: I'm here for my annual check-up.
A: Well, the nurse already took your blood pressure and she said it looks a little high.
B: That could be related to my thyroid medication.
A: That could be it. Let me listen to your heartbeat.
B: Does it sound good, doctor?
A: Sounds nice and strong to me.
B: I am concerned about some pain I've been having in my knee.
A: Are you very physically active?
B: I'm training to run the marathon.
A: That puts a lot of pressure on your knees.
B: I hope I don't have to stop training.



A: Let's discuss the security deposit.
B: Do you have the full amount for the deposit?
A: I think I do. How much was it again?
B: It was a total of $1,000.
A: Can you please explain how a security deposit works?
B: You don't know? I thought you did.
A: I just want to make sure I have it correct.
B: The security deposit ensures coverage for any damages you may cause to the apartment at your departure.
A: I see. Is that it or is there more to it?
B: The security deposit also could be used to help repay any owing rent you may have.
A: Okay, that's what I was thinking. Thanks for confirming that information.
B: Sure thing. You're welcome.



A: I can't study at home, because my family talks so loudly.
B: Study at the library.
A: Can you focus in there?
B: Yes, it's always really quiet.
A: I'll go today.
B: Make sure you get a good seat.
A: Are there not enough seats for everyone?
B: It depends on when you go.
A: I'm going at 1:00 a.m.
B: Dude, it's not even open that late.
A: But that's the best time for me.
B: You can always try a cafe. They tend to close late or not at all.



A: Want to go to the writing workshop with me today?
B: Nah man, my writing skills is tight.
A: You mean "are" instead of "is," right?
B: Yeah, of course!
A: You should come with me. Our college has great workshops.
B: I don't want to look stupid.
A: You won't. You look stupid using incorrect grammar.
B: Fine. How long is the workshop?
A: It's about an hour.
B: I don't think my attention span is more than 5 minutes.
A: Don't worry, I'll pinch you to wake you up.
B: That's a clever idea.



A: Hello, officer. I want to report a car accident.
B: What was the cause of the accident?
A: The other driver had been drinking.
B: Are there any casualties?
A: No, both drivers are fine.
B: Where did the accident take place?
A: It's on the corner of Fifth and Vine Street.
B: How many people are involved in the accident?
A: There are two cars. Each car has two people in the vehicle.
B: We will respond as soon as possible.
A: Thank you. Can you hurry; it looks like one of the drivers wants to leave.
B: We will get there as soon as possible.



A: Please have a seat.
B: Thank you.
A: I am very disappointed in you.
B: I know. Believe me, I tried very hard to make your deadline.
A: I was depending on that report.
B: I know, but unexpected circumstances came up.
A: Unexpected circumstances?
B: Yes. I would have had it ready in time, but the computer crashed.
A: The company computer crashed?
B: Yes, it did. I had weeks of saved work on it when it crashed.
A: So your report was ready?
B: Yes, it was. The crash deleted all my work.
A: Okay, I'll check with IT. Thanks.
B: You're welcome.



A: Would you like to donate money for Christopher?
B: Wait, what happened to Christopher?
A: He was hit by a car after school the other day.
B: What? That was terrible!
A: That day I was going to walk home with him, but I decided to go to the library.
B: I can't believe it. Is he okay?
A: He broke some bones, but other than that, he is okay.
B: Oh, great! So, why are you collecting money for him?
A: The hospital bills are sort of steep. His parents can't afford it.
B: Oh, wow! Well, here is my last $10. Please send my best to Chris.
A: Thank you. Every dollar counts.
B: Bless your heart for helping him out.



A: Have you checked your smoke detectors recently?
B: No, I wasn't even aware we had smoke detectors.
A: All the apartments are equipped with them. It's an essential safety feature.
B: How do you check if they're working?
A: It's real easy. If you like, I could show you.
B: That would be nice of you.
A: Are you doing anything right now?
B: No. It's my day off work.
A: How about I come over and show you how to check them?
B: Sounds good. Come inside.
A: It's really easy to check them. Just grab one from the wall, and check the battery in the back.
B: What does this light mean?
A: If you see the light, that means it's functioning.
B: So I don't need to replace the battery. Thank you so much.



A: I want to make a complaint about the all-day bus tour I took yesterday.
B: I'm sorry you have a complaint.
A: I actually have a few complaints.
B: Please tell me what went wrong.
A: We were stuck in traffic for an hour.
B: Well, that's out of our control.
A: The bus had no air conditioning.
B: It was 60 degrees out yesterday though.
A: I want a full refund.
B: I can't give you a full refund since you enjoyed part of the tour.
A: How about a partial refund then?
B: I will give you a partial refund for the unsatisfactory tour.



A: There are some charges on the final bill that are incorrect.
B: Okay, sir. Can you tell me which ones are in dispute?
A: I never ordered this movie "The Care Bears Christmas."
B: Are you sure your kids didn't order it?
A: I don't have any kids. Besides I was at the theater at that time.
B: All right, I'll take that charge off your bill. Anything else?
A: Yeah, I didn't drink 4 bottles of Grey Goose from the minibar.
B: I remember you calling for more vodka, sir.
A: Yeah I ordered three more bottles, but I didn't drink any of them.
B: Maybe you don't remember drinking the additional three bottles?
A: What are you trying to say, that I'm an alcoholic?
B: No, sir. I'm just reading what is in our system.



A: Excuse me, bus driver. I have a question.
B: What do you need to know?
A: I don't recognize where I'm going. Where are we?
B: You are on the bus headed to East Los Angeles.
A: Oh, I see. I believe I have gotten on the wrong bus.
B: Well, I'm sorry, but I can't give you a refund.
A: That's fine. I need to go to Pasadena. Can you give me directions?
B: Sure. I have a bus pamphlet for you, too. Here you go.
A: Thank you. I'm new to the area.
B: Don't worry. It happens. I'll let you off down here.
A: Alright. Thank you very much. Have a nice day.
B: You too, and good luck getting to Pasadena.



A: You can't check out this one. It's a reference book.
B: What does that mean?
A: It means you can only read it in the library.
B: But I need it for my essay.
A: You can take pictures of the pages you need.
B: I need almost all of them.
A: You can keep coming back here.
B: That's so inconvenient.
A: It is, but they have to be kept here.
B: I guess I can take pictures of the pages then.
A: Sorry about the inconvenience.
B: It is okay. It's not your fault.



A: This is a great apartment.
B: I'm glad you found it to your liking.
A: I knew I would, judging from the description I read.
B: Are you ready to discuss payment?
A: Yes, I think I am.
B: You will have to pay for the security deposit.
A: Security deposit? What is that for?
B: It's simply money you give to me as a kind of insurance in case you cause any damage to the apartment.
A: I understand. That makes sense.
B: So are you ready to pay the deposit?
A: How much are you asking?
B: It's at least $1,000 for the security deposit.
A: Alright, I could provide that much.
B: Perfect! I think we are ready to sign the lease.



A: Help! I need the doctor immediately.
B: What is the problem, sir?
A: I think my wife had a stroke.
B: What symptoms does she have?
A: Look at her! She is awake, but in a catatonic state.
B: How long has she been like this?
A: She's been like this since this morning.
B: She should be taken to the hospital.
A: But this is the doctor's office. You can't help her?
B: She needs to see an emergency specialist.
A: What can you do for her?
B: We are going to have her transferred to the nearest hospital.



A: I'm planning to study abroad this summer.
B: Cool! Where are you going?
A: I'm going to Italy.
B: What are you studying there?
A: I'm taking a cooking class.
B: That sounds interesting.
A: I'm excited to learn in a totally new environment.
B: Italy seems beautiful.
A: It's beautiful in the pictures I've seen.
B: Take a lot when you're there.
A: I will, and I'll study hard, too.
B: Also, learn some Italian while you're there.



A: Hello, is this the Smith residence?
A: Children, it's time to go to bed!
B: But we're not sleepy yet!
A: If you get into bed right now, I'll read you a fairytale.
B: One with a princess and a prince?
A: Of course, and a magical dragon, too.
B: Why do we hear fairytales before bed?
A: So that the magic from stories can grow while you're sleeping.
B: What does it grow into?
A: Why, magical dreams, of course!
B: Please read us two tonight!
A: Alright, but only if you sleep as soon as I'm done!
B: We will. It's a promise!



A: Have you read the new Batman comic issue?
B: No. Is it out in stores already?
A: Yes. A new shipment arrived just yesterday.
B: I'll go get it as soon as my shift is over.
A: It's really amazing!
B: I love this series. The villains are so cool!
A: I know what you mean. They have great backstories!
B: I never get tired of reading Batman.
A: I wonder if they will make another movie soon.
B: I like the comics better than the movies, though.
A: Me too, but comics don't have special effects!
B: I guess the movies have their perks, too.



A: This is 911. What is your emergency?
B: I think my wife just had a stroke or a heart attack.
A: Can you describe her symptoms?
B: She is unconscious but breathing. She won't wake up.
A: We are sending an ambulance right now.
B: How do you know my address?
A: We can track it down through our phone system.
B: How long will it take for the ambulance to get here?
A: It should be there in less than five minutes, sir.
B: I think I hear the ambulance coming now.
A: Please let the paramedics in so they can take your wife to the nearest hospital.
B: Thank you. I'll open the door.



A: I am so upset.
B: Oh, no. Talk to me about it.
A: I can't register for a class I really need.
B: Is it full?
A: I have a hold on my record, because my library books were overdue.
B: Can't you just pay the overdue fees?
A: I can't afford it. I'm totally broke.
B: How much do you need?
A: I need $50.
B: Wow, you must have kept those books long past the due date.
A: Yes, I know I am horrible.
B: I'll lend you the money.



A: Did you see the police posters in the neighborhood?
B: I haven't seen them. What do they say?
A: They say not to leave anything valuable in your cars at night.
B: Sometimes I leave my purse in the car.
A: Well, the posters say that there has been an increase in car break-ins in our neighborhood.
B: Do they have any suspects?
A: The police haven't released any details yet.
B: I'd better be more careful about what I leave in my car overnight.
A: Yeah, you should be on the look out for suspicious people.
B: What makes a person look suspicious?
A: People looking into cars seems suspicious.
B: Maybe I'll park my car in the garage from now on.



A: what are you doing on Friday night?
B: I was just going to stay in and watch a movie on Netflix.
A: How about you let me take you out to a movie?
B: That would be really nice.
A: We could even grab a bite to eat afterwards.
B: I would really like that.
A: Great! If I pick you up at 6 p.m., would that work?
B: Yeah, that gives me time to change after work.
A: Can I have your phone number so I can call when I'm on my way?
B: That's a great idea. And you should give me your number, too.
A: Okay, I'm really looking forward to Friday.
B: We're going to have a really nice time.



A: Good Morning! EDD, how can I help you?
B: Hello, I recently lost my job. Can I file for unemployment?
A: Yes, you certainly can.
B: How do I file a claim?
A: The easiest way is to go online.
B: All right, I will. What's the website.
A: Just do a search for "EDD" and you will see the site.
B: I will, but what if I need help?
A: There's online help, but if you still need help, call back.
B: Okay, I will. Thank you.



A: Hello, is this the Smith residence?
B: Yes it is, may I ask who is calling?
A: This is your bank calling in regards to an overcharge on your credit card.
B: I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.
A: It says here that you charged over $500 on it yesterday.
B: That can't be right; I have not used it in months!
A: Are you saying you did not make that charge?
B: That's exactly what I am saying.
A: Looking closer, this charge was made in a different city.
B: I am looking for my card now and I cannot find it.
A: This calls for further investigation.
B: I assure you I did not make the purchase.



A: Election Day is next Tuesday.
B: Did you register to vote?
A: How do you register?
B: If you are a U.S. citizen, 18 years or older, you can fill out a form.
A: What does the form ask you?
B: It asks for basic details like your name, address, age, and what political party you want to join.
A: Do I have to choose a political party?
B: No, that's optional, but if you choose a party, you can vote in certain primaries.
A: What happens once I register?
B: You'll get a voter card in the mail.
A: What good is that?
B: It will tell you where your polling place is.



A: Good day! Thanks for meeting with me.
B: You're welcome, Ms. Thomas. Please sit down.
A: Thank you. Please call me Jane.
B: All right! Jane and you can call me Dave.
A: I am looking to buy a house for myself and my son.
B: Wonderful! Buying is always a good idea. Do you rent now?
A: I did, but for the last six-months, I've been living with my mother.
B: I see. Can I ask you what you do for a living?
A: I work for the city planning department.
B: That's a good job. How long have you worked there?
A: For about three years now.
B: All right. Let's get started. I'll see what we can do.



A: Did you get invited to Wanda's party this Sunday?
B: I did. I even went shopping for a new outfit.
A: Did you also go shopping for a gift to bring?
B: We're supposed to bring gifts?
A: Of course! You can't just show up at someone's house empty handed.
B: I don't even know what Wanda likes.
A: You can buy something that everyone at the party will like.
B: It's not everyone's party, it's Wanda's party.
A: I mean you can bring a fruit salad or some wine.
B: Not everyone drinks wine though.
A: I'm just giving you suggestions.
B: I guess I'd better go back to the mall.



A: Greetings, neighbor. How's it going?
B: Hello to you! It's going just fine. Welcome to the neighborhood.
A: Thank you. How long have you been living here?
B: It's going to be my tenth year next month.
A: That's quite some time. Where did you move in from?
B: I was living in San Diego before I moved here.
A: That's interesting. Why did you decide to leave San Diego?
B: I simply felt that it was time for a change.
A: I see. I've had that feeling before.
B: why are you moving here.?
A: Because my new job is in the area.
B: Well, I'll be seeing you around, my new neighbor.



A: Good morning. How are you today?
B: I'm fantastic. How about yourself?
A: That's great! I'm good, but I feel a little sick.
B: That's not good. I heard there is a flu going around.
A: Well, I have to be sure to take good care of myself.
B: Sucks that you aren't feeling well, it's a nice day.
A: It is. The sunshine makes me want to go to the beach.
B: That's a great idea, but I think you'll get sicker if you go.
A: True. Perhaps we can go some other time?
B: For sure. Let's get together next week and go if you're better.
A: Sounds like a plan. I'll talk to you later.
B: Cool, see you later.



A: Can you make dinner for your sister tonight?
B: Aw, she only eats macaroni and cheese!
A: What's the problem?
B: I don't know how to make it.
A: It's super easy, just follow the box instructions.
B: We're all out of instant macaroni and cheese.
A: Well, make it from scratch, then.
B: How do I do that?!
A: Just cook the pasta, and mix it in cheese, milk, and butter.
B: It can't be that easy.
A: Cooking isn't hard at all. You can do it.
B: If I accidentally burn the house down, it's not my fault.



A: I'm looking for an apartment. Have you seen any apartments for rent?
B: No, I have not. I'll keep an eye out.
A: Thank you. That's very helpful of you.
B: You're welcome. What kind of an apartment are you looking for?
A: An apartment with one bedroom.
B: In what city?
A: In the city of Pasadena.
B: You should try looking in the local newspaper.
A: That's a good idea. I'll try that today.
B: Let me know if you find any apartments.
A: Alright, I'll keep you in the loop.
B: Good luck in your search.



A: Thank you for calling Eagle Airline.
B: I would like to book a round trip flight from Los Angeles to New York City
A: What date do you want to leave Los Angeles?
B: I want to leave on September 1st.
A: Do you prefer a morning flight?
B: Can you get me on a red-eye out of LAX?
A: I can book you on an overnight flight that will get you into New York City at 6 a.m.
B: Make sure I land in JFK not LaGuardia airport
A: Okay, so I have you on an overnight flight from Los Angeles International Airport leaving at 10 p.m. to JFK.
B: I don't want to have anyone climbing over me to use the bathroom while I sleep, so I want a window seat.
A: I will put you in window seat 13A.
B: Make sure that isn't an exit row because I don't want to have to help in an emergency.



A: Are you having dinner with us tonight?
B: Yes I am. I'll be out of work soon.
A: Okay, I'm thinking of the Pasta House.
B: Oh, that place gets crowded. Maybe we should make reservations.
A: That's a good idea. We waited an hour the last time.
B: Yes. It is best to do that first.
A: What time should we set the reservation for?
B: Well, I'll be home by 6 o'clock.
A: Okay, I'll make the call. I'll let you know.
B: That's great, thanks. I hoped they're not booked.
A: We should be able to get a table. I'll call right now.
B: Don't worry about the time. We can eat later if we have to.



A: I'm going to book our hotel reservation online.
B: Are you going to book directly from the hotel website?
A: I think if I use a service like Hotels.com, it is cheaper.
B: You should compare the websites and see which gives us a better deal.
A: It asks us how many nights we are staying.
B: You are also going to have to tell them how many adults and children are staying in the room.
A: The hotels.com website compares prices for different hotels.
B: Pick the one that is cheapest, but has the nicest rooms.
A: How can I tell?
B: Look at the pictures and also read the reviews.
A: How do I pay once I pick a hotel?
B: Here, take my credit card.



A: It's time to start thinking about marketing our home.
B: Won't our realtor do that?
A: Yes, of course, but we can make some suggestions.
B: What suggestions?
A: I definitely want to have a "For Sale" sign on the lawn.
B: That's funny. Don't all houses for sale have that?
A: No, not really. A lot of homes are just listed on the Internet.
B: why do you want the sign then?
A: I still think it is an effective tool in selling a house.
B: Okay, you're the boss.
A: We'll also have a listing online, so we can reach more people.
B: Sounds good to me. We should do well then.



A: Hi, I'm Janet. I live next door.
B: Oh, hello Janet. I'm Richard, and this is my wife Wendy.
A: We're going to be living side by side; we should make the best of it.
B: I totally agree.
A: My husband will be home soon. He wants to meet you, too.
B: That would be great. I was hoping to make new friends.
A: Me too. I knew the Thompsons for years. They lived where you do now.
B: How long have you lived here?
A: For 25 years. I love this neighborhood.
B: That sounds perfect to us.



A: Okay, I talked to my boss. Here's his phone number.
B: Thanks a lot, bud. Did he say he has an open position?
A: No, but he said he would talk to you.
B: That's great! Hey, thanks again.
A: You know, you should also go online to look for work
B: Online? Where?
A: There are many job search websites.
B: Do you know any by name?
A: Just Google "Jobs in L.A." and you'll find some.
B: Okay, I'll try that when I get home.
A: You can do it on your smartphone, you know.
B: I know, but I think it's better at home, thanks again.



A: Before you take your written test, we need to take your picture.
B: Okay, where do I go?
A: I can take the photo. Stand behind the red line, please.
B: Where do I go to take the test?
A: Go on the other side of the wall, and pick a stall.
B: Sounds good. May I have a pencil?
A: Sure, the pencils are at the front desk.
B: Where do I obtain the test?
A: They will give you your test. Remember, eyes on your own test.
B: Of course. This reminds me of school.
A: Yeah, we get that a lot.
B: Will they let me know if I passed the test or not?
A: Yes, they will let you know after you finish.



A: I don't know what university to transfer to.
B: There's a lot, so it's all about picking what suits your needs.
A: For starters, I would like a university in a safe area.
B: Okay, what else are you thinking about?
A: I want to live close to home.
B: I think UC Irvine would be good.
A: I don't think that's good for my major.
B: What's your major?
A: I'm majoring in philosophy.
B: Yeah, you're right. UCI is not good for philosophy.
A: I also want to go to a college that will increase my job opportunities.
B: Let's go do some online research.



A: I really need a book, but I didn't see it on the shelf. 
B: According to the computer, it's not checked out yet.
A: Then why isn't it on the proper shelf?
B: It means that someone in this library is holding it right now.
A: So someone else has the book and plans on checking it out?
B: Either that or someone took it out of the shelf and misplaced it.
A: I really need that book.
B: You're going to have to look everywhere for it.
A: Can't you just make an announcement asking whoever has the book to come forward?
B: You are not that special. When it comes to books, it's first come, first serve.
A: But I need it for school.
B: I'm sorry, but I can't do anything for you.



A: Hey, Mark. Do you know where I can look for used cars?
B: You could always check online. My friend bought a car from Craigslist.
A: Yeah, I was thinking about that. Do you know any other way?
B: There is a dealership that sells used cars on Atlantic Boulevard.
A: Where is it? I have never seen one.
B: It's on the corner of 7th and Atlantic.
A: Oh, by the Burger King?
B: Yeah. They have a pretty good selection. You should check it out.
A: I'm down. Can you go with me?
B: Sure, I am free tomorrow and Thursday. Shoot me a text.
A: Will do, man. Thanks.
B: Sure thing, bro. You owe me, though.



A: Do you want to come with me to Walmart?
B: What do you need to buy?
A: I'm out of groceries.
B: Groceries are expensive at Walmart!
A: You really think so?
B: Yes! You should buy groceries at the market.
A: I also need some new blankets.
B: Well, you'd buy that at Walmart.
A: If Walmart sells both, why go to different stores?
B: You'll save money if you do.
A: Why will I save money by going to different stores?
B: Stores have different prices for different things.



A: Excuse me, sir. Care to help me?
B: What can I do for you?
A: I'm trying to make way back home, and I'm not sure what bus to take.
B: Where do you live?
A: I live in the city of Bell.
B: I've never heard of that city.
A: I'm not surprised you haven't. It's not a big city.
B: What are the surrounding cities?
A: They're Maywood, Huntington Park, and Downey.
B: I'm familiar with the city of Downey.
A: Would you know how to get there by bus?
B: Yes. Take 764 bus northbound.
A: Thank you. I'll find my home from there.
B: You're welcome. Good luck, and take care.



A: Ew! Look what I found in this book.
B: What is that?
A: It's a dead bug.
B: It's all squished and messy.
A: I can't read this book without being disgusted.
B: But don't you really want to check out this book?
A: I do, but I really can't.
B: I'll check it out then.
A: You can read it without being disgusted?
B: Yeah, I'll just skip that page.
A: There could be something really interesting on it.
B: Whatever! I'm just going to check out the book.



A: Hi! How are you?
B: I'm doing good. Hey, did you apply for the job?
A: I sure did. I'm meeting your boss today.
B: Today, but it's Saturday.
A: I know. I'm meeting with him at a restaurant later.
B: That's cool. He must be very interested.
A: Can you describe him?
B: Sure. He's a tall Asian, who is a bit overweight with long black hair.
A: Well, that helps. This is the first time I will see him.
B: He's really friendly, and he always wears a tie.
A: Okay, thanks. That helps.
B: No problem, my friend. Good luck on your interview.



A: Hello. I was in an accident earlier today.
B: Okay, did you get the appropriate information from the other driver?
A: Yes, I did. Just tell me what you need.
B: It would be better if you came into the office.
A: When can I come in?
B: You can come in tomorrow. What time works for you?
A: I can make it in tomorrow at noon.
B: Great. Can you give me your full name?
A: Yes, it's David Mark.
B: Okay, Mr. Mark. I have you scheduled for tomorrow at noon.
A: Sounds good. I will see you tomorrow.
B: Please remember to bring in all the information you got from the other driver.



A: Hello, is this the Smith residence?
A: David! Clean your room. It's filthy!
B: It's not so bad, mom.
A: I don't even remember what color the carpet is!
B: It's blue, I remember.
A: Have you no shame?
B: What should I be ashamed of?
A: There are clothes all over the ground!
B: It's just easier to leave them there.
A: Your floor is not a gigantic closet.
B: I never said it was.
A: Clean your room or you can't go out today.
B: Fine, fine. I'll clean it now.



A: I hope I can find a job after graduation.
B: What is your major?
A: My major is geology.
B: Geology majors aren't very high in demand, but you'll do fine.
A: What makes you say that?
B: You're smart and likeable. Don't worry.
A: Thanks, but I'm still scared.
B: Oh, hey! You should go to the job fair.
A: We have that here?
B: Yes. Take advantage of it.
A: Have you ever been there?
B: Yes, and it's really helpful. Dress nicely!



A: Have you seen my mailbox key lying around somewhere?
B: No, I'm sorry. Where did you last leave it?
A: I thought it was in my pocket.
B: Is that where you last put it?
A: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
B: Think hard. Where was it before you supposedly put in your pocket?
A: I was in my apartment cleaning out the kitchen.
B: Maybe you emptied your pockets while you were cleaning.
A: Wait! I think I did empty my pockets!
B: There you go. I knew it.
A: I remember now. My keys are on the kitchen counter.
B: That's a relief.



A: What's your policy towards owning pets in the apartment?
B: I usually don't permit any kind of pets.
A: Would you be willing to make an exception?
B: It depends on the pet. Are you a pet owner?
A: I have a few rabbits and hamsters.
B: How many exactly?
A: I have two rabbits and three hamsters.
B: As long as you keep them inside your apartment I don't see why they would be a problem.
A: I'm guessing cats and dogs are not permitted?
B: Not, they are not. I'm sorry to say.
A: Did something happen that made you change your policy towards cats and dogs?
B: Yes. A tenant previously owned a dog and the dog attacked another tenant one day.



A: Did you hear about Joseph and Michelle?
B: No, what happened? Did they have a divorce?
A: Oh, no. They are pregnant.
B: Really? How far along is Michelle?
A: Joseph told me that she is four months.
B: Oh, okay. How is he handling the news?
A: He was a mess the last time I saw him.
B: How is he now? Is he still crazy?
A: Actually, he seems relaxed and collected.
B: I can't believe Joseph is going to be a father.
A: It's trippy, huh? He is our age.
B: This is making me feel really old.



A: What are some of the best things to see in this city?
B: If you want to go sightseeing, we have a tour that leaves from the hotel.
A: I'd rather explore the city on my own.
B: In that case I can give you a map that highlights some of the best things to see.
A: That sounds perfect.
B: The map also has coupons attached for some restaurants and shops near the landmarks.
A: I love a bargain.
B: You can walk around the city, but I'll also give you a subway map in case you want to take the train.
A: The subway looks scary in the movies and on TV.
B: It isn't scary at all.
A: Can I get a subway pass from you?
B: No, you'll have to buy that at the train station.



A: I'm checking out, but is there a place I can store my luggage for a few hours?
B: Why do you need us to hold your luggage, sir?
A: My flight doesn't leave for another four hours.
B: We can hold your luggage, but there is an additional cost associated with that service.
A: How much is it going to cost me?
B: It will be $6 an hour.
A: I'm going to drink at your hotel bar. Can you hook me up?
B: Unfortunately, sir, we cannot. Shall I take your credit card?
A: No, forget it. It's cheaper for me to use a locker at the airport.
B: Those airport lockers are not always safe though.
A: I'll take my chances.
B: Good luck with that, sir.



A: Top of the morning to you, Mr. Bus Driver.
B: Hi, good morning. Where are you off to today?
A: It's my first day of college.
B: Wow, you must be very excited.
A: You have no idea how much I am.
B: Do you know how to get there?
A: It's actually just a bus ride away.
B: Are you planning on taking the bus routinely?
A: Yes, I am. Why to spend money on gas when I could take the bus for less?
B: You know, as a student you're eligible to receive a discount.
A: No kidding. How much is the discount?
B: Are you paying for a month pass?
A: Yes, it cost fifty dollars.
B: Well, with a student discount it would cost twenty dollars less.
A: Thirty dollars for a month pass? That's quite a discount!
B: You should take advantage of it.



A: We think your leg may be broken.
B: How will you know for sure?
A: We're going to take you to Radiology to get it x-rayed now.
B: Will the x-ray hurt?
A: It's a pain free procedure that allows us to take a picture of your bones.
B: Are there any side effects associated with taking an x-ray?
A: Diagnostic x-rays are safe as long as they are not overused.
B: I've never had an x-ray in my entire life.
A: Then you should be fine.
B: Can someone be in the room with me?
A: Someone can be in the room with you, but not next to you during the x-ray.
B: Please go get my wife then.



A: I am so sick of dining hall food.
B: Me too! It's so unhealthy.
A: We should go to a restaurant nearby.
B: Want to go to Health Nut?
A: What a funny name!
B: I like it!
A: Do they sell nuts?
B: I'm not sure. Anyways, I want to try their organic tofu.
A: I'm allergic to tofu.
B: That's okay! They serve a wide variety of food.
A: Great! I'm just glad we're not eating dining hall food.
B: Me too. Let's go!



A: Hello, this is my first time here. I could use some help.
B: Okay, I can help. What is it you want to do?
A: I need to use the database on your computer.
B: Well, I need something from you before I can allow you to do that.
A: What do you need from me?
B: I will need you to fill out this form, and show me identification.
A: Okay, I'll do that. I can then search your database?
B: Oh, no. You'll need to ask for permission.
A: Here's the form and my ID.
B: Wonderful. You can ask Mr. Lee for permission now.
A: That's super. Thanks.
B: You're welcome. Good luck.



A: I think these puppies are hungry!
B: They've done nothing but play all day.
A: Do you think they're old enough to eat kibble?
B: They're six weeks old; I think they're old enough.
A: Look! They're digging right in!
B: Now they're settling for a nap.
A: Between keeping them from chewing things and cleaning, they're a hassle.
B: Yeah, they are. But look how cute they are while asleep!
A: Suddenly, I don't mind the chores so much.
B: Yeah, neither do I.
A: These puppies are truly worth it.
B: I wouldn't lose a single minute with them.



A: Can I ask you a question?
B: Sure, go ahead.
A: How is your relationship with your parents?
B: It's good. I get along with my father more than I do with my mother.
A: If I may ask, why is that?
B: I'm not comfortable answering that. Why are you asking?
A: It's for a class project. Why don't you get along with your mother?
B: What class are you doing this for?
A: It's for my psychology class. Do you live with your dad or mom?
B: I live with my dad.
A: Do you think that's why you don't get along with your mom?
B: I said I'm not comfortable talking about that. Change the subject.



A: Oh, no! I'm locked out again.
B: Did I overhear you say what I think you just said?
A: That I'm locked out? Yes, that's what I said.
B: I'm sorry to hear that. How did you lock yourself out?
A: I'm pretty sure I left my key inside the apartment.
B: That happened to me before.
A: What did you do when it happened?
B: I climbed into the window to unlock the door.
A: That doesn't sound like such a bad idea.
B: Unless you have a spare key.
A: It seems I'm going to have to break into my own apartment.
B: Be careful not to break anything.
A: Is that what you did when you did the same?
B: Accidentally, yes, I did.



A: I'm sorry, but today's bus tour has been canceled because of the weather.
B: Now what am I supposed to do?
A: The hotel's concierge will be happy to find you tickets to a local theater production.
B: I'm not really a theater person.
A: How about we get you reservations to one of the city's finest restaurants?
B: That sounds good.
A: What kind of food do you like?
B: I love seafood, especially lobster.
A: I'll book you a table at the Lobster Shack restaurant then.
B: Will the hotel provide transportation?
A: We can get you a cab.
B: I'd prefer a limo.



A: Everything seems to be in order. I'm ready to move into the apartment.
B: Good, I welcome you to your new home.
A: Is there anything else I should know before I start my move?
B: Now that you mention it, yes, there is. It's the policy I have on pets.
A: Do you allow any kind of pets?
B: Only caged pets, I'm sorry to say. I hope this won't be a problem.
A: Actually, I might prove to be problematic because I have a cat.
B: There lies the problem. I'm sorry, but some of the other tenants have allergies to cats.
A: That's too bad. I don't know what I'm going to do with the kitten.
B: Perhaps you can give it away. Do you know of anyone who might want a cat?
A: No, not really. What about you? Would you like a cat?
B: Me? Well, I've never owned a pet before, let alone a cat.
A: Cats make great companions. Please take mine. You would be doing me a huge favor.
B: Alright, why not? Bring the little fellow next time.



A: I'm so glad you could squeeze me into your schedule today, doctor.
B: Sure, what seems to be the problem?
A: I was in a small car accident last month, but only recently noticed some neck pain.
B: Is there any bruising?
A: Not that I can see.
B: Show me where the pain is.
A: The pain feels like a sharp stabbing followed by a dull throbbing.
B: I don't see bruising, but there could be nerve damage.
A: So what do I do next?
B: I'm going to refer you to a nerve specialist.
A: Do you think I can sue?
B: Is that what this is all about?



A: Hi, I am here to buy a bus pass.
B: Alright. What kind are you interested in getting?
A: I'm not sure. This is my first time.
B: If you need a monthly pass, it will be sixty-four dollars.
A: Is there anything cheaper than that?
B: If you're a student, you get a discount.
A: Yes. I am a student. How much will it be for a student discount?
B: The student discount for a monthly pass is thirty-five dollars.
A: Alright. I think I'll take that.
B: First I'll need to see your student ID. Then you're all set.
A: Here is my student ID. Thank you very much.
B: Here you go. Have a nice day!



A: Can I leave a package here to be picked up?
B: Absolutely, sir. What is your name?
A: I'm Bill Collins. My room is 108.
B: Who will be picking up the package?
A: It's my girlfriend, Katie Black.
B: She will have to present identification when she picks it up.
A: That's fine. I'll let her know.
B: What time will she be picking the package up?
A: She'll be here after 2 p.m. Is that all right?
B: Not a problem at all. Could you just write all the info down?
A: Why did I bother telling you everything then?
B: Writing it down will make sure that if I'm not here someone will know what to do.



A: I'm sorry to knock on your door at this late hour.
B: Is there something wrong?
A: It's just one minor issue I have to bring up with you.
B: Don't tell me. I think I know what it is.
A: I hope you can understand.
B: I completely do. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize how loud my television was.
A: It's just a little too loud. If you could just lower it a tad bit.
B: This is so embarrassing for me. You have my sincerest apology.
A: No, that's alright. It happens to all of us at one point.
B: It's these new speakers that I bought. I'm just learning how to use them.
A: Please, say no more. Let's just put the matter to rest.
B: This won't happen again.



A: Doctor, I have a few questions I would like to ask.
B: I'd be happy to answer your questions.
A: Based on my test results, do you think I should be taking a multi-vitamin?
B: Your levels are all within the normal range, so just eat vitamin rich food.
A: I am trying to get pregnant.
B: Then you should take a pre-natal vitamin.
A: Those are expensive.
B: An alternative would be to eat food enriched with Folic Acid.
A: What foods are enriched with Folic Acid?
B: Some cereals and breads now are enriched with Folic Acid.
A: What if I'm staying away from grains?
B: Then you should take a vitamin with Folic Acid.



A: I need to cancel a reservation.
B: Can you tell me the name the reservation is under?
A: Sure! The reservation is under the name Carlos Jones.
B: Can you please confirm your billing address?
A: It's 116 Lighthouse Road in Boston.
B: Did you want to reschedule the reservation?
A: No, I need to cancel it outright.
B: So I'm canceling the reservation from March 3 through 5th, correct?
A: That is right.
B: The cancelation will be subject to a $15 cancellation fee.
A: No one told me that when I made the reservation.
B: I'm sorry, sir. You can pay the cancellation fee or be charged for the full stay.



A: Can I check the apartment for any damages?
B: Absolutely, let me accompany you.
A: Did the previous tenant maintain the apartment well?
B: For the most part, yes. A few repairs had to be made.
A: What kind of repairs?
B: Mostly plumbing repairs, but the exterior of the apartment is immaculate.
A: Whoa, you weren't kidding. This apartment is in mint condition.
B: I wouldn't worry too much about the plumbing.
A: It's all in working condition?
B: Yes, I guarantee that is. I hired the best plumber in town to fix the minor problems it had.
A: That's good to hear. I think I've finished checking the apartment.
B: Don't hesitate to notify me of any concerns that may arise.



A: Hello, is this the Smith residence?
A: What's for dinner?
B: I should be asking you that.
A: What? Why do you say that?
B: You're old enough to cook dinner.
A: Are you saying it's my turn now?
B: Actually, that's exactly what I'm saying.
A: What would you like to eat, then?
B: I'm craving some spaghetti, bread, and even a salad.
A: Frozen pizza it is, then!
B: You are so lazy! Can you even cook?
A: Of course I can cook! I choose not to.
B: You're having hot pockets for dinner tomorrow.



A: how's it going?
B: Same old stuff. What's up?
A: I'm working on this project. Can you look at it?
B: Yeah, I'll take a look at it. What is it supposed to be?
A: It's a presentation on how to increase productivity.
B: Really? This is your project?
A: Yes. I came up with an idea, and my boss wants to see it.
B: That's awesome. Let's see it.
A: Well, that's it. What do you think?
B: I really liked the graphics. I think it's a winner.
A: That's great. I am really nervous.
B: Don't be. It is very professional, and it's a great idea.



A: Come in, please. Take a seat wherever you like.
B: Thank you. It's been a long and hot day.
A: It has been a hot one. Would you like something to drink?
B: What do you have?
A: We have soda, juice, and bottled water.
B: I'll take bottled water, and my wife would like one, too.
A: Sounds good. Would you like it in a glass with ice?
B: Yes, that sounds wonderful.
A: We also have some slices of pineapple. Would you like some?
B: Pineapple would hit the spot. I would love some.
A: Does your wife want some as well?
B: Actually, she doesn't like pineapple. Thanks, anyway.



A: I can't believe today is the last day of our vacation.
B: We should shop for some souvenirs to bring back home to our friends.
A: I'd much rather we spend another day seeing the sights.
B: We can sightsee and buy souvenirs along the way.
A: Why don't we just buy souvenirs at the airport?
B: The airport charges way too much for souvenirs.
A: Our friends won't know the difference.
B: We will know!
A: The hotel has postcards in the lobby, I think.
B: Postcards are to be mailed not given as souvenirs.
A: Fine! Let's go to the museum gift shop.
B: That's a great idea.



A: I'm going to be so late. This bus driver is driving so slowly.
B: Where are you in a hurry to?
A: I have doctor's appointment. I hope I make it on time.
B: I'm sure you will. Where's your clinic?
A: It's in Long Beach.
B: I'd say we're about twenty minutes away from there.
A: I sure hope you're right about that. Where are you heading to?
B: I'm going to visit my grandma.
A: Where does she live?
B: She's also in Long Beach.
A: What a coincidence! Do you often ride this bus to visit her?
B: I have for the past two years. I visit her every Sunday.
A: That's so sweet of you. You must love her very much.
B: I do. Why are you going to the doctor's?
A: To get my routine check-up. Nothing serious.
B: It's so nice to meet friendly people on the bus.



A: Why are you taking so long? Is something wrong?
B: Sorry, my bag of chips got stuck.
A: Vending machines suck, huh?
B: They're the worst, but the food is great.
A: It might come out if someone buys an item from the same column yours is on.
B: Can you be that "someone?"
A: Sure, why not? I could use some chips.
B: Thanks! Hey, what is your name?
A: My name is Charlie.
B: Nice to meet you, Charlie.
A: What is your name?
B: Hater of Vending Machines.



A: Can I help you with something?
B: Yes, I hope that you can.
A: What seems to be the problem?
B: Do you know what time it is?
A: It's eleven o'clock at night.
B: Actually, it was eleven an hour ago.
A: Oh, you're right about that.
B: I live right next door to you, and your loud music is keeping me awake.
A: Is that so? It's really that loud?
B: Yes, it is. I'm going to have to ask you to lower down the noise.
A: Sorry about that. I'll lower down the music.
B: Thank you. Please be a little more considerate next time.
A: I will. Again, I apologize for the noise. It won't happen again.
B: I sure hope it won't.



A: Would it be okay if I checked the apartment for any damages?
B: That's fine with me. Step inside.
A: Thank you. I'll take a quick look around.
B: Feel free to take your time.
A: Right away I noticed some cracks on the kitchen tile.
B: Where? Can you show me?
A: Yes. It's right at the corner, next to the sink.
B: I see it. I'll have that repaired right away.
A: Thank you. That would be great.
B: Take a carful look around the apartment, and tell me of anything else that needs tending to.
A: Here's something else. These doors are kind of loose.
B: It's the screws on them. I'll have the screws replaced as soon as possible.



A: I didn't like the way you sang tonight.
B: Oh, wow. Well, thanks for coming out.
A: You didn't put in all your effort. That's all I'm saying.
B: Okay, well I'm going to leave now.
A: Why are you in a rush to leave?
B: Because you are being rude, and I don't want to speak to you.
A: Well, now I know you can't take criticism.
B: It's not that I can't take criticism; it's that I don't like jerks.
A: How am I a jerk? I'm just giving you my honest opinion.
B: Well, in my honest opinion, I don't care what you think.
A: Now, that was rude. I don't want to talk to you anymore.
B: Great. Believe me; I won't be losing any sleep.



A: Hey! Are you busy?
B: Not at the moment. What's going on?
A: I wanted to run something by you. It's an idea for work.
B: Okay, shoot.
A: Well, I'm thinking of asking my boss to change the work schedule.
B: Why? What's your idea?
A: It's to change from five, eight-hour days, to four, ten-hour days.
B: Wow. That's a big change. I don't think he'll go for it.
A: It's still 40 hours per week, and everyone will get an extra day off.
B: I don't think it will work. It's not a good idea.
A: Why is it not a good idea?
B: Companies should be open five days a week. Sorry, I don't like it.



A: I would like to purchase the book for Sociology 130.
B: May I see your student ID?
A: I didn't know we needed it.
B: Please go get your ID, and get in line again.
A: But I waited in line for two hours!
B: I'm sorry, but you need a student ID to purchase textbooks here.
A: Are there any other options?
B: Show me proof that you're a student at this college, and you'll be good.
A: I have my report card. Here it is.
B: This will do. Nice grades by the way.
A: Thanks! I worked very hard for them.
B: Good luck with this semester.



A: Officer, my wallet and passport are gone.
B: We'll file a report so that no one else tries to use your passport.
A: What about my credit cards?
B: You'll have to call the credit card companies and have them cancel the cards.
A: How will I get home without a passport?
B: You can't get home without a passport.
A: So what should I do?
B: Call the nearest U.S. Embassy and tell them what happened.
A: Will I need to apply for a new passport?
B: Most likely you will.
A: Is that going to take a long time?
B: Just take a copy of this police report and see if that will make the process faster.



A: In order to check for an infection, we are going to need a urine sample.
B: How does that work?
A: Take this little cup, and pee in it.
B: Do I have to fill the whole cup?
A: If you fill it half way, it will be fine.
B: What do I do with the cup?
A: Put it in the plastic bag and leave it on the tray in the bathroom.
B: No one else will take my sample?
A: The nurse will take it when you leave the bathroom.
B: I'm glad I drank some water while I was in the waiting room.
A: We would have given you water and waited until you need to use the bathroom.
B: You don't need to wait because I'm ready to use the bathroom now.



A: Hi! Can I ask you a question?
B: Sure. What do you need to know?
A: Is this bus headed toward Monterey Park?
B: Yes, it is. I'm going to Monterey Park, too.
A: Thank you. I was just making sure. I'm new to the area.
B: I've lived in this area for a while.
A: I'm visiting friends. If you don't mind me asking, what are you going to do?
B: I'm going to visit the markets and stores there.
A: Nice. Do you recommend any restaurants in Monterey Park?
B: You should try the Elite Restaurant. It's pretty good.
A: I'll be sure to check it out. Here comes our stop. Have a nice day.
B: Nice talking to you.



A: Do any public buses run nearby?
B: Yes, in fact many buses do.
A: Can you tell me where I can catch them?
B: Down the street the 260 bus picks you up and takes you to Los Angeles.
A: How frequently does it pass?
B: That bus passes every 30 minutes.
A: How much is the fare?
B: For most it's two dollars and fifty cents.
A: Is it possible to buy some kind of pass for the bus?
B: Yes, you can. There are daily, weekly, and monthly passes you can purchase.
A: Do you know the cost of them?
B: If I'm not mistaken, it's five dollars for the day, twenty dollars for the week, and fifty for the month.



A: You really shouldn't wear all that bling when we go sightseeing today.
B: Why are you such a scared cat?
A: You look like you want to be mugged.
B: Stop nagging me and walk with me to the ATM so I can get a lot of cash out.
A: You should only carry what you need for the day.
B: I don't want to have to make multiple trips to the ATM.
A: If you are robbed, they will take everything though.
B: Why are you so obsessed with crime?
A: It's just that criminals look for careless tourists.
B: You make it sound like every city is dangerous.
A: Cities have good and bad things.
B: Well, let's enjoy the good things and not expect the worse.



A: I just read your proposal.
B: What did you think about it?
A: You definitely have some good ideas.
B: Well, I worked on it very hard.
A: I'm concerned about the cost, though.
B: I thought you might be. Here's a cost analysis I ran.
A: It says here that your proposal will pay for itself in a year.
B: That's what I put in the report. 
A: That's impressive. If this is true, I'm certain this can work.
B: I'm quite sure it will work.
A: You have done a good job. We'll discuss this at our next meeting.
B: I appreciate your confidence in me.



A: Do you have any tips on how to stay healthy?
B: How do you think I got to look this good at my age?
A: Let me guess, you drink a lot of water?
B: I drink at least eight glasses a day.
A: I bet you exercise every day, too.
B: I try, at the very least, to walk 20 minutes a day.
A: I didn't think walking was good exercise.
B: Walking briskly is great exercise.
A: What about eating habits?
B: Try to eat as much non-processed stuff as possible.
A: What do you mean non-processed?
B: If it's in a can, a bag, or a box it's probably processed.



A: It's 4 a.m. already? I have to be getting home.
B: You can stay over if you want. I have an extra bed.
A: I appreciate the gesture, but I must get home.
B: Do you want to hang out tomorrow night?
A: I would love that. I will call you after I get out of work.
B: What time do you get out?
A: If my boss isn't there, I should be getting out at around 8:00 p.m.
B: And if your boss is there?
A: Then I will be getting out sometime around 10:00 p.m.
B: Great. We could go grab a drink after you get out of work.
A: That sounds lovely, good night.
B: Good night. Drive home safely.



A: Who do I have the pleasure to speak to this afternoon?
B: Hello, my name is James.
A: You've called your city's local plumber. What can I do for you?
B: Thank you. I have a problem with my gas line.
A: I specialize in gas line problems. You're in luck.
B: I'm glad to hear that. Can you come to my home today?
A: I'm booked today, sorry. Can I come tomorrow instead?
B: Tomorrow works for me too. Is three o'clock fine?
A: Yes, that hour is fine.
B: What are your rates?
A: I will provide you with an estimate free of charge when I see the problem.
B: Alright, that sounds good. Thank you.



A: I have to go to Downtown Los Angeles today.
B: What for? Are you visiting someone?
A: No, I have an important job interview there.
B: How are you planning on getting there?
A: I would drive. but my car overheated last night.
B: It looks like you're going to have to ride the bus.
A: I haven't ridden the bus in years.
B: I can help you out if you want.
A: That would be great! What could you tell me about the bus system in Los Angeles?
B: Speaking from experience, I could tell you how efficient it is.
A: Do you take the bus to Los Angeles frequently?
B: Only every week, Monday through Friday for the past two years.



A: Wow! Your books are over the due date by one month.
B: It would have been longer if there wasn't a hold on my record.
A: What kind of hold is on your record?
B: A hold that won't let me go to the college football game.
A: Oh, that's tough.
B: Yeah. My girlfriend is actually a cheerleader, and so I have to go.
A: You're not going to like what I'm going to say.
B: What is it?
A: I can't remove the hold even if you pay the overdue fee.
B: Is it a technical error?
A: I don't know! I just can't remove it!
B: If my girlfriend breaks up with me, I'm blaming you.



A: Do you ever take public transportation to get around?
B: Before I frequently did. Not so much anymore. Why do you ask?
A: I wanted some information about the public transportation that is available in the city.
B: I could provide you with some. What would you like to know?
A: What kind of public transportation is there?
B: There is a local shuttle bus that could take you almost anywhere in the city.
A: It does not take you outside the city?
B: Unfortunately it does not. But it's cheaper than other public buses that do.
A: I see. And where is the nearest stop from here?
B: It's really close. Just a block away towards that direction.
A: That way? I see. Thank you.
B: You can't miss it, and you're welcome.



A: How are you?
B: I'm doing well. How are you?
A: I'm fine, thanks. I was wondering if you read my report.
B: Yes, I did read your report.
A: Well, what did you think?
B: To be truthful, I didn't like it much.
A: Oh, no. Why not?
B: I don't have the time to discuss this now. Let's make an appointment.
A: Okay, but generally speaking, what was wrong with it?
B: I just don't feel confident in it.
A: I can make it work. All I need is time.
B: I like your enthusiasm, but it's too risky, sorry.



A: Come inside and meet my family.
B: How should I greet them?
A: They will probably want to hug you.
B: That's a little awkward.
A: It's just part of their culture.
B: Anything else I should prepare myself for before going in?
A: You should accept something to eat or drink even if you are not hungry or thirsty.
B: Is that part of the custom?
A: Yes. If you refuse, it is considered very rude.
B: I don't want to disrespect your family.
A: You'd better not disrespect them.
B: Don't worry, I'll do you a solid.



A: This floor is falling apart.
B: How can you tell?
A: Are you kidding me? Step over here.
B: You're right. The floor to this apartment is badly damaged.
A: See, I told you so.
B: What did you do that made the floor like this?
A: It wasn't me. It was like this when I moved in here.
B: You should report this poor upkeep to the landlord.
A: You're right. I'll call him the first thing in the morning.
B: Be carful not to damage the floor any further.
A: I won't. I hope the landlord replaces the floor soon.
B: He probably will.



A: What do you plan to do after you graduate from here?
B: I'm planning to go to medical school. You?
A: I'm planning to teach English in underprivileged countries.
B: That's really kind of you.
A: Thanks. The first country I'm teaching in is Kenya.
B: While you're at Kenya, I'll be studying for medical school.
A: What kind of doctor do you want to be?
B: I want to be a pediatrician.
A: Because you like kids?
B: I don't really have a good reason. I just think I'll be good at it.
A: You should do what you love, not necessarily what you're good at.
B: That is very cheesy advice.



A: I saw a commercial about a heart medication.
B: You don't have any heart problems.
A: I know, but the ad suggested I ask my doctor if that medication was right for me.
B: As your doctor, I can tell you that you don't need any heart medication.
A: Okay, what about this medication that has the commercial with the couple in the bathtub?
B: What about it?
A: Can you prescribe that to me?
B: The only thing I am prescribing you is an antibiotic for your strep throat.
A: What do I do with this piece of paper?
B: Take it to the pharmacy, and the pharmacist will give you the antibiotic.
A: What if it doesn't work?
B: Come back to see me again.



A: I want to get to Monterey Park. What bus should I take?
B: If you're in Maywood, you can take the 260 bus on Atlantic.
A: How long will it take me to get there?
B: It will take you about thirty minutes depending on traffic.
A: That's not too bad.
B: Yeah, it really isn't.
A: Are there a lot of people on that bus?
B: The 260 bus can get pretty full except on holidays.
A: Thank you for telling me.
B: No problem. Where are you going?
A: I'll be visiting friends.
B: That's nice. I hope you have fun.



A: Hello, my name is George. What's your name?
B: Hi George, I'm Christine. Nice to meet you.
A: Hi Christine. Have you worked here long?
B: Almost two years now, and you?
A: This is my first week. I really like it so far.
B: Yes, it's a good place to work.
A: I like how it seems so organized.
B: That's one of the things I like best, too.
A: The benefits aren't bad, either.
B: No, they're not. I especially like the health plan.
A: That's great. I'll be eligible in July for that.
B: You're going to like it here. This is the best place I've worked.



A: Have you found an apartment?
B: Yes, I have.
A: That's great. Where is it at?
B: It's in downtown. Have you ever been there?
A: No, but I hear that area could be kind of sketchy.
B: Don't worry. The apartment is in a pretty safe part of town.
A: That's a relief. When are you moving?
B: This weekend, Saturday.
A: Have you hired any movers?
B: No, I have not. Know any good movers?
A: Sure, I'll give you the number to the movers that can help you.
B: Gee, thanks. I appreciate the favor.
A: You're welcome.



A: The parking permit is $200 per semester, right?
B: It's actually $300.
A: Why?! That's ridiculous.
B: It's because of the budget cuts.
A: That's a terrible excuse.
B: It's the truth.
A: Give me something better than that.
B: Miss, if you don't want to pay, then don't.
A: This is so stressful.
B: I advise writing a letter to the dean.
A: I bet he'll just throw it away.
B: You would be surprised.



A: The floor to my apartment is badly damaged.
B: I'm sorry to hear that. How bad is it?
A: It's practically falling apart.
B: Did some kind of accident cause this?
A: None that I could've made. I think your previous tenant might have caused this.
B: That makes sense. He took poor care of the apartment.
A: I could see that myself.
B: I'll have that fixed as soon as possible.
A: If it's not too much trouble, may I request one more thing?
B: Is there anything else wrong in the apartment?
A: It's just my bedroom window. I can't seem to get it open.
B: I'll have that window taken care of as well.



A: Where can I find the shuttle bus?
B: There're a number of shuttle buses you can take here at the airport.
A: I am looking for the shuttle bus that will take me to the rental car location.
B: Those are out the doors and to the left.
A: Are those shuttle buses free?
B: If you have a reservation with the car rental company, they are.
A: I forgot to make a reservation.
B: The rental car companies have kiosks at the other end of the airport.
A: Maybe I'll just take the shuttle bus to the subway.
B: That shuttle bus is free and is to the right when you exit.
A: Is there a shuttle bus to take me all the way home?
B: There is a company that offers that for a fee.



A: How much does it cost to ride the bus?
B: The cost is one dollar and fifty cents.
A: I'm going to have to spend nearly ten dollars today on just bus fare alone.
B: Why do you say that?
A: I have to take six buses in total today.
B: Why so many?
A: Three buses to get to where I'm going and three to get back home.
B: You should just buy a pass for the day.
A: A pass? What's that?
B: It's literally a pass that allows you to ride any bus for free.
A: Wow, that sounds like a good reason to buy one.
B: You definitely should. You'd save money in the long run.



A: There really is no place like home even after a vacation.
B: Um honey, did you tell the neighbor to water the plants?
A: I thought you did.
B: What about the mail, did you tell the neighbor to pick that up?
A: So I have to do everything around here?
B: What about the cat?
A: What about the cat?
B: Did you get the neighbor to feed the cat while we were gone?
A: Cats are pretty good at taking care of themselves.
B: I can't believe you!
A: At least no one broke into the house while we were gone.
B: Thank goodness for the small miracle.



A: Hey! Did you ever find a new apartment to move into?
B: Yes, I did! The apartment is in a convenient location.
A: Nice! Where is it located?
B: It is in the city of Pasadena and near both my school and job.
A: That's great! It seems you found the perfect place.
B: Thanks. I'm glad too. Could I ask you for a favor?
A: Sure. What is it?
B: Would you be able to help me move into my new apartment tomorrow?
A: Yes, I would be glad to.
B: Awesome! I just need help moving my furniture in.
A: No problem. I'll stop by tomorrow morning.
B: Great. Maybe we can go out for pizza right after we finish.



A: Oh, I am so tired.
B: I know what you mean.
A: I don't know if I can continue working like this.
B: I know. I've been doing it a lot longer than you.
A: Isn't there something we can do?
B: I have complained about the double shifts before.
A: What has management told you?
B: They said they are hiring more people, and that this is temporary.
A: I need this job, but I don't like these hours at all.
B: Just hang in there. I'm sure it will change.
A: It'd better change, and the sooner the better.
B: You're right. People may start leaving.



A: Do you have a car on campus?
B: No, because it's hard to find parking here.
A: How do you get to places then?
B: I walk or take the bus.
A: That's crazy! I could never do that.
B: You should. It's great for the environment.
A: That's true. What do you do for fun then?
B: There's a lot of stuff to do around campus.
A: I never realized.
B: You should do some exploring.
A: You convinced me. I won't bring my car this semester.
B: We can walk to places together now!



A: I'm going to commute to school by bus this year.
B: You should consider getting a bus pass.
A: Why should I buy a bus pass?
B: It's cheaper compared to manually paying every day.
A: What kind of pass do you recommend I get?
B: You should get the monthly pass.
A: How much is a monthly pass?
B: It is $64, but because you're a student, you can get a student discount.
A: How much will it be with a student discount?
B: It will be 35 dollars.
A: Wow, that is cheap.
B: You'll need your student ID.



A: I finally found an apartment to move in.
B: That's great to hear. Kudos to you.
A: Thanks, it wasn't easy finding one.
B: Are you moving in soon?
A: Yes I am. This weekend, in fact.
B: Have you hired any movers?
A: No, I have not.
B: Why not? Don't you know of any in the area?
A: That's not the problem. I don't think I have enough to afford movers.
B: That's too bad. Is there anything I could do to help?
A: Actually, I was going to ask for your help.
B: You're going to need at least one more other person to help you move.
A: You're right about that. So can I count on you to help me?
B: You bet. I would be happy to help you move.



A: You know you can't park here, right?
B: Listen, I had to talk to my friend really quickly, and there was no parking spaces.
A: I'm going to have to give you a ticket.
B: I'm a broke college student.
A: And I'm a broke police officer. Deal with it.
B: Can't you just let me off with a warning?
A: No way. I have to be firm with you.
B: I'll buy you a box of donuts.
A: You have got to be kidding me.
B: I thought all cops liked donuts.
A: That's a stereotype. You should really learn to be quiet.
B: I'll stay quiet if you let me off with a warning.



A: I know a lot of you have been working double shifts lately.
B: Yes, we have.
A: I am pleased to say that we have hired some help.
B: Alright! That's great. When do they start?
A: One person will start next week. The others will follow.
B: Only one? You promised more help last week.
A: I know I did, but the search has taken longer than I thought.
B: Oh, no. That's terrible.
A: Don't worry. I promise you all, I'll get some help.
B: Okay, thanks. These 16-hour days are killing us.
A: Help is on the way. I promise.
B: That's good enough for us.



A: I need to buy a bus pass.
B: Where do you need to go?
A: I have to go to the Los Angeles Library.
B: You need to buy a buss pass, that's for sure.
A: I don't know where to buy it.
B: You've never purchased a bus pass?
A: I wouldn't be asking if I did.
B: It's easy to buy a bus pass. All you have to do is get on the bus and ask for one,
A: It's that easy? Are you sure?
B: Don't you believe me?
A: I do, but I thought it would be more complicated than that.
B: There are other places where you can buy them.
A: I think I'll just buy the pass on the bus.
B: Alright, suit yourself. And you're welcome.



A: Hey, were you able to find a new home to move into?
B: Yes, I did. Now I just have to move my things over to the new place.
A: That's great! I'm glad you found a new place.
B: Me too. Have you ever used a moving company before?
A: Yes, I have. And the company is not bad.
B: I'm planning on moving soon. I have never called a moving company before.
A: Oh, I see. You have to call them as soon as possible.
B: Really? Why is that?
A: Moving companies tend to get booked really fast, especially during the summer.
B: That makes sense. I guess I should call a moving company right now.
A: Good luck. I hope the move transitions smoothly.
B: Thanks you for your advice. See you later!



A: I'm thinking of joining a sports club on campus.
B: You should! It takes away the stress of studying.
A: What sport do you play?
B: I actually play on our university's baseball team.
A: That's cool! You must be really good.
B: Yeah, I have a baseball scholarship.
A: No wonder you're in such great shape!
B: You'll be in great shape too after joining a sports club.
A: I'm thinking of joining the tennis club.
B: I wouldn't if I were you. The members don't even play tennis.
A: What do they do then?
B: They just talk about tennis. They never even touched a racket, though.



A: Excuse me. May I ask you a question?
B: Sure. What do you need to know?
A: Do you know where I can purchase a bus pass?
B: Yes I do. There are several places where you can purchase them.
A: Could you please tell me where?
B: There is one on Norwalk, one in Long beach, and one in Santa Clarita.
A: Do you know how to get to the one located on Norwalk?
B: Here is a list of directions you can have.
A: Can I keep it?
B: Yes. You can keep it.
A: Thank you very much. This is very helpful.
B: No problem. I'm glad I could help.



A: Why do you seem so tired today?
B: I stayed up all night watching that new anime.
A: You stayed up to watch it again?
B: I just had to find out what happened next!
A: I don't think it's good to watch so many cartoons.
B: Anime series are not cartoons!
A: Of course, they are! They're drawn and colored.
B: Anime is not for children. The stories are more intense.
A: I think you're just telling yourself that.
B: Cartoons don't have storylines like anime series do.
A: Either way, it's just a silly television show.
B: You really don't understand the life of a fan.



A: I have an extra ticket to the Beyonce concert on Friday.
B: That's nice.
A: I was wondering if you want to come with me?
B: I really like Beyonce, but I'm busy on Friday.
A: Oh, I understand. Maybe we could go out some other time.
B: That's so sweet of you, but I don't think so.
A: Why not?
B: You're not really my type.
A: How do you know if you won't give me a chance?
B: Well, your insistence makes you seem a little desperate.
A: I'm not desperate. I've just liked you for a long time.
B: Again, that's sweet, but I'm not interested.



A: I need to report a robbery.
B: Who was robbed?
A: I was robbed.
B: I'm so sorry. When did this happen?
A: It happened 10 minutes ago.
B: Where were you robbed?
A: Right outside the bank. I had just taken money from the ATM.
B: Can you describe the person who robbed you?
A: He was wearing dark sunglasses and a Yankees baseball cap.
B: How much money did he take from you?
A: He took everything I had in my wallet.
B: You're going to have to fill out a police report.



A: Welcome to the Silver Wok. How can I help you?
B: Hello, I was hoping you have a table.
A: We should be okay. How many guests?
B: It's a birthday dinner. We have 12 guests.
A: Oh, let me check if I have room for you. Your name, please.
B: I'm Mr. Johnson. I would appreciate it.
A: Okay, Mr. Johnson. I will have a table soon.
B: Oh, that's wonderful.
A: It's near the back. Is that okay?
B: Yes, I suppose it is. I was hoping for window seating though.
A: I can accommodate you, but it will take a little more time, sir.
B: That's okay. We'll wait.



A: Let's book a trip to Puerto Rico.
B: There are so many online services that let us book from our computer right here at home.
A: How will we know we're getting a good deal though?
B: If we use a site like Expedia or Priceline, we can find something within our budget.
A: Can we book both flights and hotels online?
B: Yes, and we can even rent a car as part of our package.
A: I just logged onto those websites, so now what?
B: Just put the dates you want to travel, where you're traveling from, and where you want to go.
A: Wow, there are even reviews from people who stayed at the hotels.
B: Yes. You can even see pictures of what the hotel rooms look like.
A: We don't get paper tickets though.
B: We can print out all the information after we book it online if you want.



A: Did you book the hotel for the trip?
B: Yes and it comes with something extra!
A: What would that be, exactly?
B: Continental breakfast every morning!
A: Wow! Do you think they serve pancakes?
B: Oh, with syrup and fresh fruit.
A: You can't forget the whipped cream!
B: And freshly brewed coffee!
A: I can't wait to see it all!
B: I think I'm more excited for breakfast than the trip.
A: Well, breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
B: That's very true.



A: I'm checking in.
B: What name is the reservation under?
A: It is under my name, Michael Roberts.
B: Can I see your identification, please?
A: Here is my driver's license.
B: I have you staying for two nights. Is that correct?
A: That's correct.
B: I need a credit card for any incidentals.
A: I don't plan on using the phone or the mini-bar.
B: I still need a credit card though.
A: Can I pay cash?
B: You will have to pay a $200 cash deposit if you don't want to leave a credit card.



A: What classes should I take to transfer?
B: You need a little bit of everything.
A: What do you mean?
B: You need to take at least one class in every subject.
A: Do I need to take a math class?
B: Even if your major is Portuguese, you have to take a math class.
A: That's so stupid.
B: It's just to make you more knowledgeable.
A: But I don't even need it!
B: It's been like this for ages.
A: Well, the policy should be changed.
B: It won't. So in the meantime, you should register for a math class.



A: So, what did you think about the car?
B: It was a good test drive, but I need to think it over.
A: Do you have any questions or concerns?
B: I'm sorry, but I don't think I am going to purchase this car.
A: If I may ask, what didn't you like about the car?
B: I don't see myself driving this car.
A: Is it the price? Let me talk to my manager; we might lower the price.
B: It's not the price. I just don't think it's the right fit for me.
A: Would you like to see another car at the dealership?
B: I'm sorry, but I didn't see any other car I liked.
A: Well, thanks for considering our dealership.
B: If I change my mind, I will let you know. Thank you.



A: I found an apartment!
B: That's great to hear. I congratulate you.
A: Thank you. I'm so glad I finally found one.
B: How did you find it?
A: On the computer.
B: How did you know to look there?
A: A friend told me to look online.
B: Where is the apartment?
A: In Pasadena.
B: That's a nice town. How big is the apartment?
A: It's big enough for me.
B: You should meet with a Rental Agent.
A: What for?
B: To get a professional opinion.
A: Good idea. Know of any?
B: You could talk to mine. Here's his business card.



A: I cut myself pretty badly with a knife. I think I need stitches.
B: Come inside so the triage nurse can stop the bleeding.
A: I was just preparing dinner and my hand slipped.
B: This cut does need stitches, but I stopped the bleeding for now.
A: Will you give me stitches right now?
B: No, since the bleeding has stopped you have to wait in the Emergency Room waiting area.
A: What do I do while waiting?
B: Fill out these registration forms.
A: When will I get my hand stitched up?
B: Here in the ER we take care of people based on how bad their injury is.
A: I was here before many of these other people.
B: Some of them are in worse shape than you.



A: Hello. What are you doing here?
B: Hi! I lost my job, so here I am at the EDD.
A: That's rough. I lost my job three months ago.
B: I didn't know that. Maybe you can help me apply.
A: Sure, I can help. You just need some basic information about your job history.
B: I have that information for the company I last worked for.
A: They ask for information on all places you worked for the last 18 months.
B: I can get that. What else do they ask?
A: Name, residence, addresses, that kind of stuff, and most importantly, why you're not working.
B: You mean if I quit, or was fired.
A: Yes, and be truthful. They will call your former employers.
A: Thanks. That helps a lot.



A: You know my birthday is coming up in three weeks.
B: So you are getting older.
A: Indeed I am, and that's why I'm celebrating with a party.
B: I love parties! When is it going to be?
A: The party is going to be the Saturday before my birthday.
B: Where is the party going to be held?
A: It's going to be at the arcade on Main Street. Will you come?
B: Of course I will be there.
A: Here's an invitation with all of the details.
B: What time does the party start?
A: It starts at 1 p.m.
B: I will be there!



A: The first thing you want to do is fasten your seat belt.
B: Check. What's next?
A: Check your mirrors and make sure you can see behind you.
B: Done. Should I put it in reverse, now?
A: Yes, ease off the brake slowly.
B: Okay, I need to turn to leave the parking lot.
A: Make sure there are no pedestrians walking behind you.
B: Okay, do I turn the steering wheel to the left?
A: Yes, make sure you are paying attention to the cars.
B: Will do. Do I put it in drive now?
A: Yes, but remember have your foot on the brake and then ease it off.
B: Wow, this seems easy. Let's go out on the street.



A: I got my roommate today!
B: That's great! When do you move in?
A: I move in next week.
B: Is there anything you have to take?
A: Yeah, there are a few things.
B: Write down a list so we can go shopping.
A: Alright. Here you go, I'm all done!
B: This is a pretty long list!
A: There's a lot of stuff I need.
B: I don't think you need a disco ball.
A: Of course I do! It goes with the strobe light.
B: Please write a more practical list.



A: I think this new place will work out great.
B: Why do you say that, Dan?
A: It seems there's so much nearby.
B: Like what, baby?
A: Didn't you see all the grocery stores?
B: I saw a couple.
A: There are lots of them, and some specialty shops.
B: That's great. Like what?
A: I saw a produce stand, and a butcher market next to each other.
B: Where was that?
A: Not far. I'll take you later.
B: That sounds great. I look forward to it.



A: I'm interested in signing up for your cable service.
B: Alright, please choose the package you'd like.
A: Does this package get me all the movie channels?
B: I'm afraid not. This is the basic package.
A: How much is it for the movie channels?
B: That package is an extra $20 a month.
A: That's going to cost me an arm and a leg!
B: You'll also get the premium sports channels.
A: Well, that does sound tempting.
B: If you sign up for our email updates, I'll give you a discount.
A: Alright, I'll take the premium package.
B: You've made a wonderful choice.


A: Tomorrow's Election Day, but I don't know where I'm supposed to go vote.
B: You didn't get a card in the mail telling you where you polling place is?
A: I think I threw it away. Can't I just go with you?
B: No. Everyone's polling place is different based on your address.
A: So how do I know where to go now?
B: You can check the Board of Elections website.
A: What if I don't have Internet access?
B: There's also a phone number you can call.
A: Where is your polling place?
B: My polling place is at the recreation center a block away from my house.
A: Will my polling place be close to where I live?
B: It should be within walking distance.



A: The best way to buy a house is to get pre-qualified, Ms. Anderson. 
B: Why is that, Mr. Williams?
A: By pre-qualifying, you know beforehand which house you can buy.
B: I thought I would look at houses first.
A: That's okay too, but you may be wasting your time.
B: How so, Mr. Williams?
A: You may find a house you really like, but can't afford it.
B: Well, that's when I'll negotiate with the seller.
A: Yes, that's true, but by pre-qualifying, you'll save time, and effort.
B: How is that?
A: You will be able to select a home you know you can afford.
B: Okay. Then we'll try it your way.



A: I am so excited. I've got my first job interview.
B: Interview for what?
A: It's an engineering internship for the city of L.A.
B: Wow, that's impressive.
A: I'm preparing for the interview by practicing with my sister.
B: What exactly are you doing?
A: We're doing mock interviews.
B: Is that helpful?
A: It sure is. She recorded our first interview, and pointed out things I should avoid.
B: What are some of the things she saw?
A: She said that I said,"You know" too much, and that I looked nervous.
B: Cool! That should help.
A: It has. I feel so confident now.
B: Well, good luck, my friend.



A: Hello. I'm new to the apartments. I have a question.
B: Hello, and welcome. What do you need to know?
A: Is there anything about parking my car that I need to know?
B: You have an assigned parking spot behind the building.
A: Are there other parking spots available?
B: Yes. We have several unassigned spots for visitors.
A: Where are those visitor parking spots located?
B: Behind the building as well.
A: What if all parking spots are filled up?
B: You could park in the streets, but you might be ticketed if you fail to follow rules.
A: Could you show me how to enter the parking area?
B: Yeah, I'll show you. Follow me.



A: Hi Jennifer, it's Doug.
B: Hello, Doug. How can I help you?
A: I'm a bit concerned with how to set an asking price for my home.
B: Well, you shouldn't worry, Doug. We will set the price accordingly.
A: What do you mean?
B: We are experts at this. We'll take all factors into consideration.
A: Such as what, if I may ask?
B: Our formula takes local pricing, comparability, and market trends into consideration.
A: That's very thorough.
B: We are real estate experts, Doug.
A: I think I made the right decision to hire you, Ms. Winters.
B: Well, thank you, Doug. It's my pleasure.



A: I've never taken the bus before.
B: This is your first time? Wow, that's surprising.
A: How is it surprising?
B: I've just never met anyone who hasn't taken the bus before.
A: Well, now you could say you have.
B: Why are you finally taking the bus for the first time?
A: I figured it would be a good way to save money.
B: That's for sure considering the price of gas nowadays.
A: No kidding. Listen, I have a few questions about taking the bus.
B: What are they? I'm sure I could answer them for you.
A: I was wondering how often the buses pass by.
B: They usually pass by every thirty minutes, but it could vary.



A: Hi, I'm James. What's your name?
B: Hi James. My name is Lisa.
A: I'm taking this class because it seems interesting. Why are you?
B: I'm taking this class because it's a requirement.
A: We should get to know each other.
B: I don't think so. I like keeping to myself.
A: So you don't like meeting new students?
B: Nope. I would rather just be alone.
A: That is so sad!
B: It's not. It's really peaceful and self-empowering.
A: Can we at least study together?
B: Nope, we can't do that.



A: Hi, can you help me find a book on tigers?
B: Yes, of course. Is it for a school project?
A: Yes, I'm doing an essay on the life of a tiger.
B: You're going to want one with a lot of words and less pictures.
A: But I want the one with pictures!
B: Pictures are pretty, but they won't help you with your essay that much.
A: Fine, I admit you're right.
B: You can borrow the book with pictures for your own pleasure.
A: Yay! I love tigers.
B: I have a book that isn't hard to understand, but still has great information.
A: Great! You're so helpful.
B: It's my job to be helpful.



A: Everything is going wrong today.
B: Well, at least the weather is nice.
A: Oh, yeah. Imagine if it had rained like they said it would.
B: I know, I would have gotten soaked walking home.
A: Yeah, I love when the sun is shining, but it's not too hot.
B: I do, too. This weather is pretty sweet.
A: I guess everything will be okay in the end.
B: So all you needed was some sunshine.
A: Yeah, I guess you were right for once.
B: Hey! I'm always right.



A: Hello, am I calling a moving company? My friend gave me you guys' number.
B: Yes, this is indeed a moving company.
A: That's a relief. I thought I was dialing the wrong number.
B: No, you called the right place. Are you in need of any moving assistance?
A: Yes, very much so. I'm moving in one week, and I need a pair of strong and able movers.
B: We can provide you with that kind of help.
A: That would be fantastic.
B: Just give me your information and we'll have you set up in no time.
A: Thank you very much.
B: You're welcome. The movers we provide will help with all your belongings.
A: That's good. I have a lot of stuff.
B: Rest assure, that won't be a problem.



A: College is so boring. All I do is go to class.
B: You should join some clubs.
A: Are you a part of any clubs?
B: Yes! I am currently in the Animal Lovers Club and the Knitting Club.
A: What do you do in the Animal Lovers Club?
B: We do a lot of things! Last week, we walked dogs.
A: That sounds fun. What's the wildest animal you ever interacted with?
B: I touched a dodo bird a couple weeks ago.
A: Dodo birds are extinct.
B: I'm just messing with you!
A: You're silly! Okay, I'll join the Animal Lovers Club.
B: Great! We always welcome new members.



A: Excuse me. Can I have a minute of your time, please?
B: Sure, what is it?
A: I'm trying to take the bus to Downey, but I don't know where to take the bus.
B: Downey? Let me think. Are you visiting relatives there?
A: My girlfriend actually is the one I'm going to visit.
B: That's sweet. I'm sorry, small talk helps me remember.
A: In that case, let me ask where are you going to?
B: I'm going to work. I take the bus there every day.
A: You must save plenty of money on gas and insurance.
B: Yup, I sure do. Wait, now I remember which bus takes you to Downey!
A: Can you tell me where to take it?
B: Sure. You need to take it on Florence Avenue in the city of Bell.



A: I have to go to bed early.
B: Why? The night is still young!
A: I have a class at 7 a.m.
B: That's tough! My earliest class is at 9 a.m.
A: That sounds amazing to me.
B: How do you stay awake in that class?
A: Before I go to class, I drink four cups of coffee and take a cold shower.
B: Interesting routine. Does it work?
A: Kind of. It's better than not doing it at all.
B: Why are you taking that class?
A: It's only offered once a year, so I have to take it now.
B: I hope the class is interesting, at least.



A: Please be carful with that.
B: Don't worry, we are professionals. Your furniture is safe in our hands.
A: Thank you. That's reassuring to hear.
B: Now, where do you want this couch?
A: Let me think. Right here is a good spot.
B: Next to the window over there?
A: Yes, that's the spot. You could put it down there.
B: Alright, next we have these end tables. Where do you want them?
A: I want them against this wall please.
B: There you are. Nice and gentle. See, I told you we were professionals.
A: Thank you. I feel more secure now seeing you work.
B: Well, that's good. Let's go get the rest of your furniture.



A: Do you know how I can get to the Gold Line?
B: Yes I do. You'll only need one bus.
A: Which bus should I take?
B: You can take the 260 bus on Atlantic.
A: How long will it take me to get there?
B: It should take you no longer than 30 minutes depending on traffic.
A: Thanks. I'll leave in a bit.
B: Where are you planning to go?
A: I want to go to Little Tokyo. I heard nice things about it.
B: Can I go with you?
A: Sure! You can then show me where the 260 stop is.
B: Awesome! I'll just grab my bus pass. Then I'll be ready to go.



A: I hate my roommate.
B: I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong with her?
A: A lot of things. First of all, she snores so loudly!
B: That's not really her fault. What else?
A: She never takes a shower.
B: That's disgusting! You should tell her to take a shower.
A: I did! She got mad at me and then proceeded to slap me.
B: Ouch! Did you try to get a new roommate?
A: I tried, but I could not. No one was willing to switch.
B: I guess you can get a new room by yourself.
A: I can't afford it. Ugh, I hate her so much.
B: It's okay. The year will be over before you know it.



A: You seem a little lost. Can I be of some assistance?
B: That would be nice of you. I just have one question.
A: You can ask as many as you want.
B: I just need to know where to change buses.
A: Well, where are you going? I need to know that.
B: I'm going to Beverly Hills.
A: In that case, you need to change buses in a few minutes.
B: What bus do I need to change to?
A: You're going to get off this one and get on Line 720.
B: That bus takes me to Beverly Hills?
A: Yes, right in the center of it.
B: Where do I change into the 720 bus?
A: You're going to change on Whittier Avenue.
B: Thank you, sir. You have been so helpful.



A: Thanks for helping me move in all my furniture.
B: No problem at all. It's a pleasure.
A: Can you help me decide where to place them?
B: Sure. Where should we start?
A: Let's start with the living room. Where do you suggest we place the couch?
B: Maybe against that wall. Then the television can be placed at the opposite end.
A: Good idea. Let's do that. Thank you for helping.
B: You're welcome. Where would you like to place these bookshelves?
A: I would like it against the wall with the window.
B: Would you like it placed to the right or left side of the window?
A: I would like it placed on the right side.
B: Good choice. Let's move the bookshelf together.



A: Hello, is this the water company?
B: Yes it is. How can I help you?
A: I just moved into my first home. I have a few questions.
B: Alright. What questions do you have?
A: What are my payment options?
B: You can pay online, by mail, or in person at designated areas.
A: Are you guys responsible for any plumbing problems?
B: The costumer is responsible for their home plumbing problems.
A: What information do you need in order to begin my water service?
B: We will need your full name, social security number, and the address to your home.
A: Thank you. That is all I need to know.
B: You're welcome. Thank you for calling. Have a nice day.



A: Are you okay? You look really sad.
B: I'm homesick. I feel so out of place here.
A: But this college is so awesome.
B: I know, but I really miss home.
A: How far do you live?
B: Far. Let's just say I need an airplane to get there.
A: It's almost winter break. Hang in there.
B: I don't think I can handle it anymore.
A: Try calling your friends and family from your hometown.
B: I don't want them to worry about me.
A: Just call them. Don't you want to stop feeling sad?
B: Okay, I'll call them now.



A: Do you know which bus will get me from Maywood to Cal State LA?
B: Yes, I do. You'll need to take two buses.
A: Which bus should I take first?
B: You'll need to take the 260 on Atlantic all the way to Garvey.
A: Which bus do I take after that?
B: You'll have to take the 70 bus.
A: Will I find the 70 bus stop immediately?
B: Yes. You'll find it right across the street after you get off the 260.
A: How long might the whole trip take?
B: It might take you about 40 minutes to an hour depending on traffic.
A: Alright. Thank you very much.
B: You're welcome. Glad I could help.



A: You have called the Water Company. How may I assist you?
B: Hello, I recently moved into my apartment.
A: Are you calling to activate your billing?
B: Yes, that's one of the things I'm calling about.
A: What was the other reason for your calling today?
B: There is leakage in one of the pipelines. Is there anything you can do about that?
A: No, I'm sorry. But I could provide you contact with one of our plumbers.
B: No, that's not necessary, but thank you.
A: As for your billing, what form of payment would you like to have?
B: Can I pay online?
A: Yes, that is a service we do provide for our customers.
B: Alright, I think I'll go with that form of payment.



A: I was wondering if I could change my major from biology to political science.
B: Those majors are very different from each other.
A: I know, but I hate biology. I can't see myself studying it anymore.
B: You can change it, but you'll have to take more classes.
A: I don't mind. Political science is really interesting to me.
B: You would be graduating a year late.
A: Oh, no. I have to think a little more about this then.
B: I think you should change it, since you hate biology.
A: Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry I am so indecisive.
B: A lot of people change majors. It's normal.
A: But not as late as I did. I hate that I'm graduating after all my friends.
B: You're making the right choice.



A: I have decided to drop out of college.
B: You're making the worst decision of your life.
A: I just don't get the point of college. It's just memorizing.
B: What are you going to do then?
A: I'm going to get a job!
B: As what? A burger flipper?
A: Don't be mean. I'm going to be rich and successful when I'm older.
B: It's almost impossible to be rich and successful without a college degree.
A: Look at Steve Jobs! He dropped out of college.
B: He's a rare case.
A: Watch me prove you wrong.
B: I'd like to see you try.



A: I gained so much weight because my college dining hall is all-you-can-eat.
B: It's called the "freshman 15."
A: What is that exactly?
B: It's an expression to refer to the observation that many college freshmen gain weight.
A: Oh, I see. I definitely got the freshman 15 then.
B: You should use your college's gym.
A: I never have time.
B: Oh, please! You just have to make time.
A: I guess I should set an hour to work out.
B: That's the attitude I like to hear!
A: Did you gain any weight?
B: Yeah, I just wear big clothes to hide my fat.



A: Excuse me. Is your name John?
B: Yes, and you must be Karen.
A: I am. I'm sorry this is the first blind date I've been on.
B: Oh, me too. I'm just as nervous.
A: Well, that's one thing we have in common already.
B: You look just like the picture Jimmy showed me.
A: So how long have you known Jimmy?
B: We actually used to date.
A: Wow, your ex set you up on a blind date?
B: He knows I'm a good catch, so he let me get away.



A: I woke up with the worse stomachache.
B: Did you try going to the bathroom?
A: I went to the bathroom, but that didn't make the pain go away.
B: Did you eat anything strange last night? Maybe you have food poisoning.
A: No. Because then I would be vomiting.
B: Where exactly is the pain?
A: It hurts here on my right side.
B: That's where it hurt when I had to get my appendix taken out.
A: It's probably just gas.
B: Did you take any medication?
A: I took an antacid an hour ago.
B: It should have worked by now. This could be serious.



A: I don't think I'll be in town on Election Day.
B: You can still vote though.
A: How can I vote if I won't be here?
B: You can file an absentee ballot.
A: How do I do that?
B: You can ask for a mail-in ballot.
A: What is that?
B: It's a form you mail in saying who you want to vote for.
A: Does it count like a regular ballot?
B: It's just as if you were voting in person.
A: I'd better ask for one then.
B: You should do it quickly since it has to be in a week before Election Day.



A: Hello, this is Sam Jones.
B: Good morning, Mr. Jones. How can I help you?
A: I've been working with one of your realtors. I'd like to view some homes now.
B: Okay. Who have you been working with?
A: I've been working with Ms. Thomas.
B: Oh, she's an excellent realtor. I'll check her calendar.
A: Thank you. I'm very anxious to get started.
B: Are you free this Saturday?
A: I think so. What time?
B: She has time between 1 - 3 p.m. this Saturday, the 12th.
A: I think that will work. Let's do it.
B: I'll be sure to confirm with both of you on Friday. Have a good day.



A: I would like to buy a plane ticket to Boston, Massachusetts.
B: What date would you like to leave and where are you leaving from?
A: I would like to travel for the Labor Day holiday and I'm leaving from Burbank airport.
B: We don't have any direct flights from Burbank to Boston's Logan airport.
A: I don't want to have a long layover.
B: I can make a reservation for you for a flight that changes planes in Denver.
A: How long is the layover?
B: The layover is two hours.
A: That will give me enough time to grab a bite. Book it.
B: Do you have a frequent flyer number?
A: What is that?
B: If you fly with us enough, you get points to earn towards a free flight.



A: You sure are buying a lot of snacks.
B: That's because I'm going on a long car trip.
A: Where are you driving to?
B: I'm driving to Comic-Con in San Diego this weekend.
A: You're driving all the way there to read comic books?
B: No. I will be meeting comic artists and voice actors.
A: That sounds really impressive!
B: If I'm lucky, I'll even meet Stan Lee!
A: Is he as famous as Bruce Lee?
B: Stan Lee is a famous comic book writer and creator.
A: I think I'd be more impressed to meet Bruce Lee.
B: Bruce Lee wouldn't stand a chance against Stan's heroes!



A: I felt the car's transmission was lagging a bit.
B: Really? I haven't felt anything.
A: Have you had the transmission checked?
B: I took it for a tune-up the other day.
A: The mechanic didn't say anything?
B: Nope. He told me that the car was in tip-top shape.
A: Would you mind if I took it to my mechanic? Just want to be sure.
B: Sure, go ahead. Would you like to take it right now?
A: Let me check with my mechanic.
B: If he is busy, then you can come back tomorrow. I am free.
A: He said he is free tomorrow. I guess I can come back tomorrow.
B: Great. Feel free to call me at any time.



A: I can't believe we're actually moved in.
B: I know. It's like a dream come true.
A: We found the stores, and schools. It's time to find a church now.
B: Yes. I can't believe I forgot about that.
A: We've been very busy, Marcy. That's okay.
B: How do we find one?
A: I guess we can call our old pastor.
B: That's right. He will know.
A: It's either that, or check the Internet.
B: I think I like the pastor idea better.
A: Yes. He can probably give us the name of the local pastor.
B: I'm so eager to start now.



A: It takes me hours to find my classroom.
B: I might be able to help you.
A: Really? That would be great!
B: What's your classroom number?
A: My classroom number is A21.
B: So the "A" is the building type.
A: Okay, but I don't know where that is.
B: Do you know where the gym is?
A: Yeah, I do.
B: Okay, your classroom is behind the gym.
A: That's really helpful! Thank you.
B: No problem, and the "21" means it's upstairs.



A: Good morning. Welcome to ABC Technologies.
B: Hi, good morning.
A: How can I help you?
B: I have an appointment with Mr. Rogers today.
A: Oh, what time is that? I don't see it on his schedule.
B: Well, there's no set time. I'm an old friend of his.
A: Okay, let me call him. What is your name?
B: I'm Tom Williams. He will know me.
A: Just a minute, sir. Please take a seat.
B: Thank you.
A: Yes, Mr. Williams. Mr. Rogers will see you soon.
B: That's wonderful. I know how busy he is. Thanks.



A: I really want to thank you again for approving that raise.
B: No problem, Val. You deserve it because of all your hard work.
A: Regardless, I would like to show my appreciation by inviting you to dinner.
B: How thoughtful of you, Val.
A: My husband and I would like to throw a dinner party in your honor.
B: That would be lovely.
A: Can you join us this Thursday evening?
B: Thursday evening works for me.
A: Please bring your wife.
B: She'll have to check her schedule, but it should work out.
A: I'm also inviting the head of the finance department and his wife.
B: They are a lovely couple.



A: Where should my hands be on the steering wheel?
B: Your hands should be on 10 and 2.
A: 10 and 2? What do you mean?
B: Think of the steering wheel as a clock, and put your hands on 10 and 2.
A: Oh, okay. What about my eyes? Should I be looking at the signs?
B: Take a quick glance at the signs, but always look in front.
A: When do I have to use my horn?
B: You should use your horn for an emergency.
A: What about if someone cuts me off?
B: That's not an appropriate use of your horn.
A: Am I ready to start driving yet?
B: No, you need to learn some more of the basics.



A: What are we having for lunch?
B: I'm making some sandwiches.
A: Can I make some lemonade to drink?
B: Sure! That'd be great.
A: We just ate breakfast, but I'm already hungry.
B: Me too! It's amazing how hungry I get so soon!
A: I'm really looking forward to those sandwiches.
B: I just realized we're out of bread!
A: I guess lunch will have to be delayed.
B: Can you please go to the store and buy some?
A: Sure! Don't drink all the lemonade!
B: I won't! Come back soon. I'm starving!



A: Hello, how may I help you today?
B: Hi. I would like to increase my Internet data.
A: I'll be glad to help you with that. What's your account number?
B: I don't have my account number with me, but my phone number is 310-865-9274.
A: Alright. I see you use our mobile service.
B: Yes. I also have a landline.
A: According to my file, you are eligible for an upgrade to our new service.
B: What does this new service include?
A: It makes the Internet connection twice as fast.
B: That sounds perfect! Is there a price increase?
A: Yes, that will be $5 more per month.
B: Sign me up right away!



A: Good Evening. I am Joseph, and I'll be your waiter tonight.
B: Hello, Joseph.
A: Can I start you off with some refreshments?
B: Yes, you can. I'll take a Long Island Iced Tea.
A: And for the lady?
B: She will have a vodka martini.
A: Those are excellent choices. How about the kids?
B: They will take regular iced teas.
A: Will there be anything else?
B: Yes, as a matter of fact. Can you bring me a beer chaser?
A: Certainly. What kind of beer would you like?
B: I want something imported. How about something from Mexico?



A: Hello, bus driver. How are you doing today?
B: Good afternoon. I'm doing just fine.
A: This is my first time taking the bus.
B: Is that so? I hope you have enough change for the bus fare.
A: Yes, I do. Don't you worry about a thing.
B: That's good. Just put your money into the machine and take a seat.
A: It's one dollar and fifty cents for the fare, correct?
B: Yes, that's correct.
A: Thank you. There you are. I told you I had enough.
B: Thank you, you're fine to sit down now.
A: Is there anywhere I can't sit?
B: The front seats hold priority for the elderly and disabled.



A: Excuse me, sir?
B: Yes, is there a problem?
A: I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, but you can't park here.
B: You mean right here, where I just parked?
A: Yes, unfortunately you cannot.
B: Oh, I was not aware that you couldn't park here.
A: That's alright. It's a common mistake new residents often make.
B: Thank you for informing me.
A: Not a problem. I wouldn't want you to get a parking ticket.
B: That's so considerate of you. Thank you.
A: You're welcome. Just keep it in mind for the next time.
B: Don't worry. I won't forget.



A: Do you know what forms I need to file an unemployment claim?
B: You can go to an EDD office or fill out a form on their website to open a claim.
A: Is it really that simple?
B: It sure is. It is easier to do online.
A: Why would I want to do it online?
B: It's faster, and you can do it from home, or wherever you have Internet access.
A: Do you know the website?
B: Yes, it's edd.ca.gov. It's easy to use.
A: Then what do I do?
B: You will have to find a link that says "Apply Here", and click on it.
A: Is that all there is to it?
B: That's it. You're good to go.



A: I have an early meeting, so can I get a wake-up call?
B: Sure! What time should we call you?
A: Can you call my room at six in the morning?
B: Just tell me your room number.
A: I'm staying in room 302.
B: Okay, Mr. Roberts. We'll call you at 6 a.m.
A: What happens if I don't answer?
B: Then you'll probably miss your meeting.
A: Can I request a second wake-up call?
B: What time should we schedule the second wake-up call?
A: Call me again at 6:15 a.m. if I don't answer at six.
B: So we have one wake-up call at six and a second one fifteen minutes later.



A: I would like to reserve The Hunger Games. 
B: Everyone wants to reserve that book these days.
A: It's really popular, because the movie just came out.
B: You have to pay $1 to reserve the book.
A: What?! That's ridiculous.
B: Like you said, it's popular.
A: I have to think about it then.
B: I personally think $1 is nothing. It's cheaper than buying the book.
A: How much is the book?
B: On the back, it says it's $15. It depends on the bookstore you go to though.
A: Fine, I'll give you a $1.
B: You won't regret it! The book is really good.



A: I need new clothes.
B: What kinds of new clothes?
A: I want something stylish.
B: What do you want new clothes for?
A: Well, school starts again in a week.
B: Looking good costs money, though.
A: I know what you mean.
B: The stuff you're looking for is expensive.
A: Yeah, I don't have much money.
B: Maybe you should try bargain shopping.
A: That sounds like something my mom would do.
B: Hey, moms are good at saving money.



A: Hello, Mr. Rogers. How are you today?
B: I'm doing well, Wendy. How are you?
A: I'm great, thanks. So are you ready to make a decision?
B: I certainly am. I'm going with your firm.
A: Oh, that's great news, Mr. Rogers.
B: Okay, so what's next?
A: I have a standard contract we use. You can look it over if you like.
B: Sure I will, but can you give me an overview?
A: It basically reads that you agree to have us act as your agent.
B: I still have the final say on the deal though, right?
A: Of course, you do, Mr. Rogers.
B: I just wanted to be clear on that. Thanks.



A: Why are you taking this class?
B: I need it to transfer. You?
A: Me too! I would never take Speech 101 if I didn't need it.
B: Yeah, I hate public speaking.
A: Me too! I get so nervous.
B: I just want this class to be over with.
A: It's going to be a long semester.
B: Maybe after this class, we'll love public speaking.
A: I doubt it!
B: I don't even know why we have to take this class to transfer.
A: I guess it's to make us better speakers.
B: It'll all be worth it when we transfer.



A: Are you the Rental Agent?
B: Yes, I am. Welcome to my office.
A: It's nice to meet you. Thank you.
B: How did you hear about me?
A: A friend referred me to you.
B: Oh really. I'm glad.
A: He said you were the right person to talk to about renting an apartment.
B: That's nice to hear. I'm flattered. How can I help you?
A: I found an apartment in Pasadena, and I wanted a second opinion.
B: Sure. Do you have the apartment's information?
A: Yes, I do. Here it is.
B: Thank you.



A: Quick! Get in here and wait out the storm!
B: Oh, my word. Thank you so much.
A: It's raining cats and dogs out there.
B: More like lions and wolves!
A: I was watching the news.
B: What did they say?
A: This is going to be one heck of a storm.
B: Should we be worried?
A: I don't think so. The emergency alert system would have gone up.
B: True. Well, thank you for saving me from this storm.
A: No problem. I'm making some tea; would you like some?
B: Please. Something warm would be great at the moment!



A: Can you describe the robbery you saw?
B: It happened right here in front of the bank.
A: Can you describe the suspect?
B: He was tall, wearing sunglasses and a Yankees baseball cap.
A: Did he have any weapons?
B: I didn't see a gun, but he had his hand in his pocket.
A: So he could have had a gun?
B: I suppose so.
A: Did you see which way the suspect went?
B: I was so scared, and was shaking, but I think he went towards the train station.
A: Could you pick the suspect out of a lineup?
B: Only if I'm sure that he can't see me.



A: Why are you holding your mouth?
B: I think I cracked a tooth. It hurts so much.
A: Did you look in the mirror?
B: No, but I can feel a sharp pain when my tongue touches my molars.
A: That sort of thing can be infected easily.
B: So what should I do?
A: You should find an emergency dentist.
B: That is going to cost so much money.
A: Yeah, but it's better than being in pain.
B: Do you think they'll have to pull the tooth?
A: Maybe they just have to seal it up.
B: Get me the yellow pages so I can find a nearby emergency dentist.



A: I'm calling because I got the invitation to your party in the mail.
B: I was worried that maybe it got lost.
A: No, it came in the mail yesterday.
B: So, will you be coming to the party?
A: You bet I'll be there.
B: Great! please feel free to bring your family.
A: I was actually looking forward to some time away from them.
B: Regardless if you come with them or solo, please don't bring any gifts.
A: Why is that?
B: My husband is having the whole thing catered.
A: I can at least bring a bottle of wine.
B: That would be nice.



A: I'm trying to get to the city of Lakewood. Does this bus take me there?
B: No, I'm sorry. You're going to have to make a transfer.
A: Can't I simply get on another bus?
B: You could, but you would have to pay again.
A: I don't think I want to pay again.
B: Especially when a transfer is free.
A: How do I get a transfer?
B: All you have to do is approach the bus driver and ask for one.
A: Alright, I will do that right now. Thanks for the help.
B: Have a safe bus ride.



A: I have a few hours to explore the city.
B: I can make some recommendations for you.
A: Great! I want to see some museums.
B: Here are some brochures for some local museums. Do you like modern or classic art?
A: I like modern art. Are the museums far?
B: It depends on which one of the two modern art museums you want to see.
A: Where is the closest one?
B: Let me show you on the map. This one is in walking distance from the hotel.
A: Is the ticket to get in very expensive?
B: It's normally $20.
A: Does the hotel offer any discount tickets?
B: If you buy the ticket here, it will only cost you $15.



A: Good morning. How can I help you?
B: Good morning to you. Yes. I'd like to file a claim.
A: Okay, I can help you with that.
B: All right. What do I need to do?
A: The easiest way to file a claim is online. You can use our computers for that.
B: That's wonderful. Do I need to log in?
A: No, you don't. Our computers are connected directly to the EDD.
B: But I don't know if I'm eligible for benefits.
A: The EDD will make that decision. Just fill in the forms as best you can.
B: Thank you. I'll use the computer here to file the claim right away.
A: If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
B: All right. I will. Thanks once again.



A: I can't spend anymore money after I buy my English textbook.
B: How much is your English textbook?
A: It's $198. I'm not kidding.
B: That's ridiculously expensive! What's the title of the textbook?
A: It's called How to Write Well.
B: Dude, someone is selling that book for $30.
A: No way. What edition is it?
B: I think it was the 10th edition.
A: Oh, no wonder he or she is selling it for only $30.
B: What edition do you need?
A: I need the 21st edition.
B: The publisher seems to be really making money, considering the number of editions.



A: You only need three more classes and you'll be ready to transfer.
B: Which classes do I need?
A: You need a history class, a physical science class, and a foreign language class.
B: Which history class should I take?
A: The one you're most interested in.
B: I looked at the course listing, and there's nothing I'm interested in.
A: In that case, go for the class you would be the least bored of.
B: I guess I could take European history.
A: There you go! How about the other classes you need?
B: I think I'll take physics and French.
A: I'm glad you know what to take! 
B: Me too. Careful planning is part of what makes up a successful student!



A: This is a little awkward.
B: I know we've been friends since high school.
A: I kind of always had a crush on you.
B: Why did you never say so?
A: You were dating my friend Katy.
B: You always gave me good advice when I was dating her.
A: That was so hard to do because I wanted to date you!
B: I'm glad we were friends first though.
A: Me too. I feel like we know so much about each other.
B: We're not starting from scratch.
A: No, it's a new stage in our friendship.
B: I think all couples should be friends first.



A: Have you decided what you're going to order?
B: I think I want to eat a steak today.
A: That sounds delicious!
B: I've been craving one all day.
A: You're making me crave one now!
B: Well, we might as well order the steak now.
A: Actually, I change my mind.
B: What are you having?
A: Shrimp pasta, it looks delicious.
B: Do you mind if I try some of that?
A: Only if you give me some steak!
B: Alright, it's perfect, thanks!



A: Unfortunately, you made a lot of mistakes. I cannot pass you.
B: What mistakes did I make?
A: You failed to put your turn signals when turning a corner.
B: How many mistakes am I allowed?
A: You are allowed three mistakes. You got five.
B: Which other mistakes did I make?
A: You hit the curb when you were parallel parking.
B: I thought you might have missed that.
A: No, you also didn't pay attention to some of the signs.
B: Which signs are you talking about?
A: You passed a yield sign, and you did not yield.
B: Can I take the test again?
A: You can take it again on Monday.



A: There certainly are a lot of places to eat around here.
B: Yes, there are. Where shall we go tonight?
A: Why don't we ask our new neighbors for a recommendation?
B: That's a great idea. They seem very friendly.
A: Yes, and they have lived here for a long time.
B: There she is. Let me ask her.
A: What did she say, honey?
B: She recommended a couple of places. What are you craving?
A: How about a nice steak?
B: Good. She said there was a good steak house about a mile away.
A: Excellent. Did you ask her if it was expensive.
B: Yes, I did. She said it was very reasonable. Let's go.



A: I must admit, Ms. Price, I'm concerned about security.
B: Don't worry, Mr. King. We will provide the security on your home.
A: What kinds of things do you do?
B: We make it look like someone is living in your home while it's listed.
A: How do you do that?
B: We do several things. We stop deliveries, mow the lawn, and set timers.
A: Is that all you do?
B: No, we have our agents drop by from time to time.
A: Oh, that's good.
B: Yes, we take home security seriously.
A: Thanks, Ms. Price. I feel much better now.
B: You are very welcome. Thank you.



A: I really liked this car. How much are you asking for it?
B: I'm asking for $2,000. It has some minor problems.
A: Yes, my mechanic told me it was a quick fix.
B: So, you want to take the car?
A: Yes, I could write you a check right now.
B: That sounds good. Could I cash it today?
A: Yeah, go ahead. It will clear, don't worry.
B: Didn't mean anything by it.
A: No, it's cool. I know sometimes you have to wait for a check to clear.
B: Great. So, could you make it out to Michael Slender?
A: Sure thing. I'm going to put "Car Payment," under the memo.
B: Sounds good, man. I will take care of things at the DMV tomorrow.



A: Good morning. My name is Robert Stevens.
B: Good morning, Mr. Stevens. My name is Richard Jones.
A: Please have a seat, and let's get started.
B: Thank you, Mr. Stevens.
A: Please call me Robert, and I'll call you Richard. We are informal here.
B: That's good to know, Robert. Thanks.
A: I see you have two years experience. Can you tell me a little about that?
B: Oh, yes. I worked in the mailroom at Acme Corporation last year.
A: Go on, please.
B: It was a temporary job, but I gained a lot of experience.
A: Excellent! We are always looking for someone with experience.
B: I think this experience will help me blend into a job working here.



A: I'm sorry, but you can't borrow this book.
B: What do you mean?
A: You have not paid your late fees for your overdue books.
B: I never had any overdue books!
A: The computer doesn't lie.
B: What books do I have late fees for?
A: They're all math books, and according to the system, you still have them.
B: Oh yeah, I do! I totally forgot about them and left them on my bed.
A: Once you return them and pay the fee, you can borrow books again.
B: But I really need to borrow those books now.
A: I can put them on hold for you.
B: Yes! You are the best.



A: Good afternoon! This is the Beach Palace Hotel. How can I help you?
B: Do you have any rooms available for this weekend?
A: Yes. How many nights will you be staying?
B: My wife and I would like to stay for two nights.
A: Do you want a room with a view of the beach?
B: Is that more expensive?
A: The room without a view is 200 dollars a night.
B: How much is a room with a view?
A: A room with a view is $300 a night.
B: Is there a room with a partial view?
A: There is a room with an obstructed view.
B: I'll take it, but only if it's less than $300.



A: Good morning. Are you the mailman?
B: Good morning to you, and yes, I am. What gave it away?
A: Your uniform was a clear indicator.
B: That's a good answer. So you're the new tenant?
A: Yes, I am. I just moved in last week.
B: I extend to you my welcome. How do you like the neighborhood?
A: It's absolutely wonderful. Everybody here is so friendly.
B: You're not wrong. I haven't come across anybody who wasn't nice.
A: Wow, it sounds like I picked the perfect neighborhood to move in to.
B: Yup, there's no doubt about that.
A: I hope I never move again.
B: I have more deliveries to make, so I'll talk to you later.



A: Now that you have your beverages, can I offer you some appetizers?
B: Yes, that sounds good. What do you have?
A: We have a wide selection of tempting appetizers.
B: May I see a menu, please?
A: Certainly. It's on the regular menu under "Appetizers."
B: Can you recommend something?
A: Of course. The potato skins are very popular.
B: Hmmm. I don't like potatoes much. What else you got?
A: How about some stuffed mushrooms, or fried zucchini?
B: That sounds better, but I'm still not sold.
A: We have an appetizer platter that includes all our selections.
B: That sounds excellent. Let's have it.



A: Someone broke into my house.
B: How do you know?
A: The front window is broken and there is glass everywhere.
B: You shouldn't go in the house until we send an officer there.
A: I'm already in the house. The house is trashed.
B: Don't touch anything until the police get there.
A: My new flatscreen tv is gone.
B: Is there anything else that is obviously missing?
A: I can't tell unless I go further into my house.
B: Please wait outside in case the robber is still inside.
A: You think he could still be inside?
B: It's a possibility. A police car will be there shortly.



A: Hello, please connect me to Tech Support.
B: This is Tech Support, how may I help you?
A: I am having problems with my Internet service.
B: What seems to be the problem?
A: None of my wireless devices are connecting to the Wi-Fi.
B: I see. Have you tried disconnecting and reconnecting the modem?
A: No, how do I do that?
B: Simply unplug the modem for fifteen seconds.
A: Alright. I plugged it in again.
B: Are all of the lights back on the modem?
A: Yes, they're all green!
B: Your devices should be able to connect easily now.
A: Oh, they're working perfectly! Thank you!



A: What are we doing here at the park? We haven't played here since we were children.
B: That's exactly why it would be so much fun!
A: I'd rather go to the movies.
B: Just sit on the swings for a while. I bet I can go higher!
A: You sound like a kid, alright.
B: Kids are the best at having fun, you know.
A: I have to admit, this does bring back some memories.
B: I still think the playground is pretty entertaining.
A: Maybe we should come swing every once in a while.
B: I think I'd be up to do something like that.
A: Cheapest form of entertainment ever!



A: Are you voting for the same mayoral candidate I am voting for?
B: There is no way I'm voting for your guy.
A: Why are you saying that?
B: Are you kidding? Have you heard him speak?
A: What do you mean?
B: I don't agree with his positions.
A: I think he has a great education plan.
B: He's going to ruin our schools with his plan.
A: Come on! How about his jobs plan?
B: That's even worse than his education plan.
A: I think you need to give the guy a chance.
B: The candidate I'm choosing is way better than your guy.



A: That is such a cute dress!
B: Thanks! I bought it yesterday.
A: Have you worn it yet?
B: No, I have to accessorize it first!
A: Did you buy everything you needed?
B: Yep! I have a matching belt, a purse, and shoes now!
A: Well, put it on so we can see it!
B: What do you think?
A: It looks nice on you!
B: Are you sure it doesn't make me look fat?
A: No way! It totally flatters your figure.
B: Thanks! I hope my boyfriend likes it, too.



A: Good evening. I'm glad you could make it.
B: I wouldn't miss this for the world.
A: Okay, let's get started.
B: Sounds fine. I'm glad we're starting here.
A: Yes, this is a great starter house, and it's in a good neighborhood.
B: Do you know anything about the schools?
A: This is part of an award-winning school district.
B: That's what I wanted to hear.
A: Let's take a look inside.
B: Okay, let's do it.
A: I figure we can view at least four homes today, maybe five.
B: That's wonderful. I'm so excited.



A: Is it a good apartment?
B: Yes. It seems fine to me.
A: That's good to hear.
B: There is only one issue.
A: What is it?
B: The landlord is asking for too much money.
A: What should I do?
B: Negotiate with him.
A: I'm not such a good negotiator. Can you do it for me?
B: For a small fee, I sure can.
A: Alright, you have the deal.
B: I'll call him this evening.



A: Heard it's supposed to rain.
B: Where did you hear that from?
A: The news. The weatherman said there is a high probability of rain.
B: Since when have you started watching the news?
A: I've always watched the news. Well, at least to check out the weather.
B: What else did they say about the weekend?
A: I think they said it was going to rain throughout the weekend.
B: Throughout the weekend? Don't pull my chain.
A: I'm not. They said it, not me. I know you had plans.
B: Well, I don't believe it. Just like I don't believe you watch the news.
A: Okay, suit yourself. I'd take an umbrella though.
B: I won't. I'd rather get wet than listen to you.



A: I sure am hungry.
B: You should go out and eat.
A: Do you know of any good places to eat that are around the local area?
B: I know of a good couple.
A: Alright, let's hear them. I'm starving.
B: Let me ask you first, what are you in the mood for?
A: Well, now that I think about it, I'm not really sure.
B: Do you like Indian food?
A: I have never tried it. It sounds interesting.
B: It's delicious. I would recommend giving it a try.
A: Indian food it is!



A: Is the location of the apartment a good one?
B: Yes. I would say so.
A: Why is that?
B: The city of Pasadena is generally safe. Have you been there?
A: Yes, it's relatively calm.
B: Do have any other concerns about the location?
A: Is the apartment's location near any shopping areas?
B: Yes, it is.
A: What shopping areas?
B: There is a place called Old Town where a lot of shops are located.
A: How far away is Old Town from the apartment's location?
B: Ten minutes away on car.
A: And on foot?
B: Twenty minutes on foot.



A: Excuse me. I would like to get a transfer.
B: Do you have your day pass with you?
A: It's a month pass. Is that okay?
B: Yes, that's fine. Please scan your pass on the machine.
A: Did it scan?
B: Yes it did. Alright, it's going to cost one dollar for the transfer.
A: I'm sorry. I don't think I have enough for the transfer.
B: Is this your first time getting a transfer?
A: Yes, it is. I thought transfers were free.
B: I'll let it pass since it's your first time.
A: Thank you so much. It won't happen again.
B: Don't mention it. Just be prepared the next time.



A: Hello, is this the Smith residence?
A: Hello, how can I help you today?
B: I am very upset with the quality of your service.
A: I'm sorry, what seems to be the problem?
B: My Internet service did not work for three days.
A: My records say a technician visited your area yesterday?
B: Yes, he installed a new modem.
A: Did it solve the problem?
B: Yes, but I was overcharged for Internet service.
A: Sorry about that. I'll give you credit for the three days.
B: I was sold a wireless service unavailable in my area.
A: I see it here; we charged you $5 extra a month.
B: Yes. Kindly return my money, please.



A: Are there any good French restaurants around here?
B: There are quite a few. I have some menus you can look at.
A: Which one do you recommend? It's my wife's birthday.
B: The French Quarter is very romantic.
A: Is it very expensive?
B: It is about $50 a person, not including alcohol or tip.
A: Do I need a reservation?
B: Yes, but I would be happy to make that reservation for you.
A: Great! Get us a table for two at 8.
B: Will you also need transportation to the restaurant?
A: Can you get a limo to pick us up?
B: I can do that for $30.



A: I'm so frustrated. I can't find any books on my research topic at my library.
B: Why don't you try a different library?
A: I don't want to waste gas money.
B: But you might find your book.
A: What library do you suggest?
B: I suggest the one near my house.
A: That is way too far for me.
B: They have a lot of books. That library has never disappointed me.
A: I have an idea! Why don't you borrow them for me?
B: I don't know about that. What if you lose the books?
A: I won't. I swear on my life.
B: Wow, you're so serious.



A: I have a really bad headache. What do you recommend?
B: You can purchase some over-the-counter pain relievers in aisle 6.
A: Do I need a prescription for those?
B: No. You just pick whichever brand your prefer and pay for it at the register.
A: There are so many choices.
B: If you read the labels, you can pick the one that is best for you.
A: Is there a difference between the name brand pills and the store brand pills?
B: Usually there isn't. Just compare the labels and look for active ingredients.
A: The store brand is less expensive.
B: Usually it is just as effective.
A: I sure hope so because I want to save money and not have a headache.
B: I think you can achieve both things.



A: Why don't you ever answer your phone?
B: I'm usually busy. What's up?
A: I wanted to see if you were down to kick it.
B: Where do you want to go? I don't have that much money.
A: Let's go for a drink at the bar where we went last week.
B: Okay, but I only have enough for three beers.
A: It's fine. I'll pay for the rest, but you owe me.
B: Screw that, I paid for you last time. You owe me!
A: Well, then we can call it even.
B: I guess so. Where should we meet?
A: How about at the train station by the bar?
B: Sounds good. I'll see you in an hour.
A: Great. See you then, laters.



A: What are you doing?
B: I'm filling out my college application.
A: Do you need any help? I applied two years ago.
B: Yes, I do need help. Should I put my ethnicity?
A: It won't be used for or against you. It's really up to you.
B: Also, should I put all of my extracurriculars?
A: Put the ones that you were heavily involved in.
B: Next question, should I put anything in the "additional information" section?
A: If you feel like you need to say something that you didn't mention before, then yes.
B: Can I say I got an A when I really just got a B? 
A: What?! Of course not! They will ask for your transcript.
B: Oh, I didn't know that.



A: Are you telling me it's not weird dating Katy after being friends with her for so long?
B: It's a little strange since I've known her for so long.
A: You also know everyone she dated.
B: I've given her advice on guys she's dated.
A: Didn't she date your best friend once?
B: Yeah, but he stopped being my best friend after I started dating Katy.
A: Why is that?
B: He thought I had always been after her.
A: Had you always been after her?
B: Honestly no. I really only liked her as a friend.
A: When did that change?
B: When I came back from finishing college.



A: Did you get the invitation to my party?
B: The invitation came in the mail yesterday.
A: I was worried it got lost in the mail.
B: Unfortunately, I can't go to your party. I wish I could.
A: I'm sorry to hear that.
B: My mother-in-law is visiting that day.
A: I'm really sorry that you can't come.
B: If I could sneak out of the house, I would, but my wife would kill me.
A: I wouldn't want that on my hands.
B: The next party you have, I promise I will be there.
A: What if your mother-in-law visits again?
B; Thankfully, she only comes once a year.



A: I think this house will fill all you needs, Mr. Jones.
B: Well, I don't particularly like the neighborhood.
A: I understand your concern, Mr. Jones, but let's take a look inside.
B: Okay, but I'm really concerned about the neighborhood.
A: That's okay, Mr. Jones. We're not married to this home.
B: I guess we can look inside since we're here.
A: Great! Let's go inside. It's a beautiful home.
B: I don't like it already. The porch is too small. I have a big family.
A: All right, Mr. Jones. This may not be the right house for you.
B: That's what I've been trying to tell you.
A: That's okay. I've got more homes to show you.
B: That's good to hear.



A: I'm so thirsty!
B: You might want to buy something refreshing.
A: I think I'd like a hibiscus tea.
B: It is kind of hot, isn't it?
A: Yes, it is. What'll you get?
B: Same as yours.
A: Awesome, we match!
B: Yeah, I guess we do!
A: Place the order. I'll spot you the money.
B: In that case, I want the biggest size.
A: Don't bite the hand that feeds you!
B: I was only kidding!



A: Have you been in your room all day?
B: Yes, I have been staying in my room.
A: It's already evening! What have you been doing?
B: I've been reading a very interesting book.
A: That is exactly why I don't like reading.
B: Why don't you like reading?
A: You could have watched three movies by now!
B: Books are always much better than movies.
A: The Hunger Games movies are pretty good.
B: They leave out a lot of the best details!
A: It's probably because the details were not that important.
B: Details are what makes life interesting!



A: We should start fixing up the interior of the house, Angela.
B: Why is that, Jonathan? Don't we have time?
A: Yes, we do, but the sooner, the better.
B: I guess so. Where do we start?
A: I think the kitchen would be best.
B: Why would the kitchen be best?
A: I just think it's a very important room.
B: Well, yes. I guess we spend a lot of time there.
A: We do. Everyone does.
B: Okay, what should we do first?
A: How about the cabinets? They're not too expensive, and it will look good.
B: Sounds good to me. I'll start looking into it tomorrow.



A: Good afternoon. I want to get a U.S. Passport.
B: Is this your first passport?
A: It is my first U.S. Passport.
B: Did you fill out the application form?
A: I downloaded the form at home and have it here.
B: Did you bring proof of U.S. citizenship?
A: What kind of proof do I need?
B: A birth certificate if you were born in the U.S. or naturalization papers.
A: I'm a new citizen so I have naturalization papers.
B: This is good because it also serves as your identification.
A: What else do I need to provide?
B: I just need $165 and two photographs.



A: Hello, my name is Angela Davis.
B: Good morning, Angela. I am Dick Williams. I'll be interviewing you today.
A: Good morning, Mr. Williams.
B: So, what do you know about our company, Angela?
A: Well, I did a little Internet research last night, and I know the company is growing.
B: Excellent! What else?
A: I learned the company is a leading seller of office technology equipment.
B: That's good, Angela. I'm happy to see you taking the time to do research.
A: Thank you, Mr. Williams.
B: I am going to recommend you for the job.
A: Thanks again.
B: Someone will contact you soon. Congratulations!



A: The test drive went well. How much are you asking for?
B: I am selling the car for $10,000.
A: Oh, wow. That's a little steep, don't you think?
B: What were you thinking? Keep in mind, it's in perfect condition.
A: Well, I would want to take it to my mechanic first.
B: From the test drive, what price are you thinking?
A: I was thinking $7,500.
B: I can't do that price. I've put a lot of work into this car.
A: Let's cut to the chase. What's your minimum price?
B: I can let it go for an extra grand.
A: So, you would let it go for $8,500?
B: Yes, that would be fine.



A: Are you ready to order?
B: Yes, I think we are, thank you.
A: Okay, what can I get you?
B: I like the look of that plate on the next table.
A: Oh yes, sir. That's our seafood platter.
B: What does it come with?
A: Fried white fish, shrimp, and scallops, along with fries, and vegetables.
B: Does it come with a salad?
A: Of course. It comes with the soup of the day, and a green salad.
B: What's the soup of the day.
A: Today's soup is clam chowder.
B: Is that New England, or Manhattan style?
A: It is the creamy-white, New England style.
B: Oh, that's my favorite. I'll take the soup.



A: Dad, I passed my driving test!
B: You did? That's great news!
A: Where do you want to go first, dad?
B: You're going to take me out for a ride?
A: Yes, where do you want to go?
B: How about we go get you a nice steak dinner?
A: That sounds great. I could go for a nice steak around now.
B: Come to the house and pick me up.
A: Would I be able to drive by myself?
B: No, you have to drive with someone over the age of 21.
A: Oh, okay. Well, can we drop off my friend that took me to the DMV?
B: Sure, we can go drop him off before we leave.



A: Did you bring the mail in today?
B: Yeah. I got it right here.
A: Oh, great. I'm waiting for my unemployment check. It's late.
B: Sorry to tell you, your payment didn't come today.
A: No way. Darn it! It's more than a week late!
B: Why don't you call EDD? I think they can tell you where it is.
A: I definitely need to call them.
B: I think it's an automated system.
A: Oh darn. I don't like automated systems.
B: The EDD system is not so bad.
A: Okay, I'll call. This is the longest the check has taken to get to me.
B: If you have problems with the system, you can speak to a person by dialing "0".



A: Do you think you can identify the man you saw robbing the woman outside the bank?
B: I think I remember what he looked like.
A: Please take a look at the six men lined up.
B: Can they see me?
A: No, they cannot see you. This is one-way glass.
B: I see the man who robbed the lady outside the bank.
A: Can you tell us which one he is?
B: It's number three for sure.
A: Number three, please step forward.
B: That's him. You're sure he can't see me?
A: He can't see you. Thanks for your help today.
B: Please don't let him rob anyone else.



A: I hate Professor Hernandez!
B: Me too! He keeps calling me stupid!
A: You think that's bad? He gave me an F, because I double spaced my essay!
B: But every professor wants essays double spaced. He's crazy!
A: Professor Hernandez is weird. He wants essays triple spaced.
B: That's just a waste of paper. Why does he like triple spacing?
A: He says it's because he has to make a lot of corrections, because we're stupid.
B: We should start a petition, and get him fired!
A: We should, but he can find out.
B: I know. If he found out, he would ruin everyone's life.
A: He is so evil.
B: That's why this petition has to work!



A: I'm really looking forward to casting my vote today.
B: Oh really? Why?
A: I think my candidate will really change the way things are done in our city.
B: How is that?
A: Her education policy will help all students.
B: I'll have to review her policy plan before I vote.
A: You really should. You're a parent.
B: What else do you like about the candidate?
A: Her economic policy will lower the unemployment rate in the city.
B: I've been unemployed for a while.
A: Then you should vote for her.
B: I'll read up on her positions.



A: Now that we're settled in, it's time to do some exploring.
B: I know what you mean. Everything is so new.
A: I think I saw a shopping mall off the highway.
B: Was it far?
A: Not really, but we did move to an isolated place.
B: Yeah, I know. I didn't figure on this.
A: Let's go. It's not that far.
B: Okay, I'll get ready.
A: Alright, I'll get the car out. It's only about 15 minutes away.
B: I hope it has a lot of shops.
A: It looked pretty big.
B: Okay, let's go.



A: I don't know which size to get.
B: Why don't you check your shoes?
A: Sizes are different with each shoe style.
B: I guess you'll have to measure your foot.
A: how do I do that?
B: There's a chart by your chair you put your foot on.
A: Oh, I found it, thanks.
B: What size are you?
A: I'm a size eight.
B: You have a small shoe size for a man.
A: It's alright, shoe size doesn't matter.
B: No. Shoe size does matter.



A: Hey, Professor Hill.
B: What is it?
A: I've been having trouble with derivatives.
B: That's not good. There's a test on derivatives next week.
A: I know. Can I make an appointment with you for some help?
B: I'm a busy man.
A: You didn't even check your schedule yet!
B: I know I'm busy, because many people already made appointments.
A: So I'm hopeless?
B: Of course not! There's the tutoring center.
A: But the tutors are not professors. They're just students.
B: They might surprise you.



A: Can you tell us what you saw?
B: I didn't see much. I was afraid.
A: Why were you afraid?
B: The man had his hand in his pocket like he had a gun.
A: Did you actually see a gun?
B: No, I didn't.
A: Did you see the man take the woman's wallet?
B: I did. I was inside the bank waiting on line.
A: Could you come to the precinct and fill out a witness statement?
B: Is it going to take very long?
A: No, it won't and an officer will drive you home.
B: I guess I can go to the precinct then.



A: How many universities are you applying to?
B: I'm applying to 12 universities.
A: Wow! That's a lot!
B: I just want a lot of options.
A: But it costs a lot of money and time!
B: I get fee waivers.
A: But how about the time? I mean, applying is a lot of work.
B: College applications ask similar questions.
A: Good for you. I'm only applying to three universities.
B: Which ones are you applying to?
A: CSULA, UC Irvine, and Yale.
B: I find it hard to believe that you can limit yourself to only three universities.



A: The apartment seems nice.
B: It sure does.
A: I just have a few questions to ask.
B: About what?
A: The apartment's location.
B: Ask away. I'll try my best to answer them.
A: Is the location in close proximity to the police department?
B: Yes, it is. Only fifteen minutes away.
A: What about the fire department?
B: Not as close as the police department, but still not far.
A: That's good to hear. Thanks for the answers.
B: Don't mention it. It was my pleasure to help.



A: That concludes my part of the interview. Do you have any questions for me?
B: Yes, thank you, Mr. Thompson, I do.
A: Okay, what's on your mind?
B: Is this a new position?
A: Yes, we have created this new position recently.
B: If you hire me, when do you want me to start?
A: We plan to hire someone by the end of this month.
B: Are there some times of the year that are busier than others?
A: Yes. The summer months are very busy here.
B: That's good to know. Does it matter if I take night classes?
A: No. The hours for the job are in the daytime.
B: Okay, I have no more questions. Thank you.



A: Hey, this is a nice library.
B: It is. I didn't expect this.
A: It doesn't look like much from the outside.
B: Didn't you know you can't tell a book by its cover?
A: That's funny, babe.
B: Anyway, we're going to need to get new library cards.
A: I'll go ask about it.
B: Okay, I'm going to check the place out.
A: I went ahead and applied for a card. You need to do the same.
B: I will right now, but look at this exhibit.
A: Wow, it's beautiful. What is it?
B: I'm not sure, but I'm going to find out.



A: Hey, where are you headed?
B: I'm going to choose some furniture at Ikea.
A: Are you redecorating?
B: Yeah. I'm tired of having mismatched furniture.
A: What are you planning to buy?
B: A couch, a coffee table, and a reading chair.
A: Won't that be expensive?
B: There's a great sale going on right now!
A: Oh, that's great! You'll get good prices.
B: I hope I find what I'm looking for.
A: Will you have it delivered?
B: No. I borrowed a pickup truck from a friend.



A: I'd like to buy some flowers for my best friend's birthday.
B: What is your friend's favorite color?
A: She loves the color pink.
B: I can make her a bouquet with pink roses.
A: I don't want roses because that seems romantic, not to mention expensive.
B: I can make the bouquet with carnations, lilies, and daisies instead.
A: That sounds friendlier and cheaper.
B: Would you like these to be delivered to your friend?
A: That would be a great surprise.
B: Just fill out this card and include the delivery address.
A: Can you deliver these today?
B: I can have them to your friend before 5 p.m.



A: Hi John, this is Katy.
B: It's so nice to hear your voice.
A: I just wanted to call you and thank you for the lovely time last Friday.
B: I'm glad you liked the movie.
A: The restaurant you picked was great, too.
B: I wasn't sure you'd be into Greek food.
A: I'm hoping we can do it again soon.
B: I really would like that.
A: I have tickets to a play on Saturday.
B: I really like the theater.
A: Then you'll come with me?
B: It sounds like we have a second date.



A: This is a great book you're checking out.
B: You have read it?
A: Read it? I memorized it! It's one of my favorites.
B: That's good to know.
A: You should check out more books.
B: I can check out more than one?
A: Of course! It would be crazy if you could only get one book.
B: That's awesome! I'll be back.
A: Don't go crazy now. The limit is 15 books.
B: Don't worry. I'll probably come back with 5 more books.
A: It's great to see a kid excited about reading.
B: Yeah, most kids hate reading. They're more into television.



A: Dude, I forgot to tell you  I'm going out with Sarah.
B: Which one is Sarah? You date so many girls that I get confused.
A: First off, I don't date that many girls, and secondly you're always confused.
B: True. So, which one is she? Is she in your class?
A: Nope. She's the girl from the restaurant we go to in downtown.
B: From Green Bamboo? Which girl?
A: The cute one. You know the one with the tattoo up her thigh?
B: I think I would have noticed that.
A: She's the only one with blonde hair.
B: Well, why didn't you just say that? That's Sarah?
A: Well, I know you check her out. I assumed you saw the tattoo.
B: I'm not that big of a pervert.



A: I hope this neighborhood is more to your liking.
B: Yes, it definitely is.
A: It's a little more money, but I think it's a great fit for you.
B: As long as I can afford it.
A: The porch is very large. I think your family will like it.
B: That's a good place to start.
A: This is the living area. As you can see, it's quite spacious.
B: Uh huh. I see.
A: And this is the master bedroom.
B: Sorry, it's a beautiful home, but it just doesn't feel right.
A: What's wrong, Mr. Jones?
B: It's the lighting, and it just doesn't feel right, sorry.



A: My doctor gave me this prescription.
B: Can I have the paper and your insurance card?
A: How long will this take to be filled?
B: We can have this filled within an hour.
A: Is there any way to fill it faster? I'm in so much pain.
B: Unfortunately there are other prescriptions to fill.
A: What am I supposed to do for the hour?
B: We can call you when the prescription is ready.
A: So I can go home and take a nap.
B: Just leave your number here at the pharmacy and we'll call you.
A: Can I send someone else to pick up the prescription?
B: Your medication is a controlled substance so the person needs to be over 18.



A: It's time to start work.
B: Okay, where do we start?
A: The best place to start is the roof.
B: The roof? Isn't that dangerous?
A: Don't be afraid. As long as we're careful, we'll be alright.
B: But I'm afraid of heights.
A: I'll be there. Like I said, we'll be okay.
B: Okay, I trust you.
A: A good roof is very important. If it leaks, it can ruin the interior.
B: Yes, I know. Remember Uncle Joe's house?
A: I sure do. Let's get started.
B: Okay. I'm ready.



A: Why are you eating another apple?
B: You know what they say about apples!
A: No, I'm afraid I don't know.
B: An apple a day keeps the doctor away!
A: Especially if you throw it at him.
B: You should eat fruit; it's good for you.
A: I do eat fruit: just not as often as you do.
B: Eating healthy is wonderful!
A: I don't doubt it, but I still want pizza for lunch.
B: Only if you eat an apple, too.
A: Alright, I'll also eat an apple.
B: That's the spirit! You're healthier already.



A: Would you be interested in donating to our candidate's campaign today?
B: Maybe. Can you tell me more about why you are raising money?
A: Sure! Campaign ads are expensive, so we want to raise money for TV ads.
B: Some of those ads are so negative though.
A: You're right, but the new ads are going to be positive.
B: How much money are you trying to raise?
A: We need a few thousand dollars
B: Is this the only way you are raising money?
A: No. We are doing phone banking and even having an event.
B: What kind of event?
A: We are hosting a lunch with the candidate.
B: I may be interested in donating for that.



A: Finally, I got my driver's license.
B: Congratulations! Can I see it?
A: Sure. Here it is. I don't like my picture.
B: Oh, wow. You blinked.
A: Yeah, they didn't want to take another picture.
B: I didn't know your middle name was David.
A: Oh, no. I didn't want anyone to know.
B: Well, you shouldn't have put it on your license.
A: I had to. When are you going to get your license?
B: I was thinking about going tomorrow to the DMV.
A: You want me to take you? I do have my license now.
B: Sure! Pick me up from my house at noon.



A: Why are you dressed in that weird costume?
B: I'm going LARPing with some friends.
A: What's LARPing?
B: It stands for Live Action Role Playing.
A: What do you do when you LARP?
B: You dress up as someone and do things in character.
A: That sounds really ridiculous.
B: It's really fun, actually.
A: Don't you feel silly wearing that in public?
B: It's all part of the fun!
A: While you do that, I think I'll go to the arcade.
B: Alright, but you're missing out!



A: Can you tell me what are the luggage limits for this domestic flight?
B: You are allowed one carry-on luggage and one personal item.
A: So I can bring this roll-away suitcase on the plane?
B: Yes. That will fit in the overhead bin so it won't cost you.
A: What is a personal item?
B: Anything that will fit under the seat in front of you is a personal item.
A: Can I bring my really big suitcase on the plane?
B: No. We will have to check that in for $35.
A: That's not included in the cost of the ticket?
B: No. The first checked bag is $35 and another will be an additional $25.
A: When I was younger, everything was included in the price of the ticket.
B: Times have changed.



A: I liked the car, but I am not happy with the price.
B: I'm sorry, but that's the best we can do.
A: Could you talk to your manager and have it brought down?
B: I could try, but it probably won't work.
A: I can't afford $15,000. The most I can spend is $10,000.
B: Let me call my manager. He is out of the office.
A: I can pay it all off now. I don't want to be making payments.
B: Well, my manager said that we can work with $11,000.
A: I can't do $11,000. How about $10,500?
B: Let me check.
A: Great. I can pay you with a check today.
B: It seems that $10,500 will work. Let's get the paperwork filled.



A: Waiter!
B: Yes, sir. How can I help you?
A: That was an excellent meal, but we could not finish.
B: Would you like a doggy-bag to take your leftovers home?
A: Yes, please. We would.
B: And did you leave enough room for dessert?
A: Dessert? Why yes, I think so.
B: Here is our dessert menu.
A: Do you have a house specialty?
B: Yes, we do. It's the apple pie a la mode.
A: That sounds good. What kind of ice cream do you have?
B: Vanilla, French vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.
A: I'll take the pie a la mode, but put the ice cream on the side, not on top.
B: Excellent choice! Okay, ice cream on the side.



A: I just got off the phone with the EDD.
B: What did they say? Are you going to get benefits?
A: Yes, but not as much as I thought.
B: What do you mean?
A: I thought I would receive a certain amount per month, but I got less.
B: Why is that?
A: I'm not really sure. It has something to do with how much I earned.
B: They pay benefits based on your income?
A: Yes. I think the more you earn, the more you receive.
B: That's interesting. I didn't know that.
A: I think I may go to the EDD office to ask about it.
B: You should go. What have you got to lose?



A: I'd like to order room service, please.
B: What would you like to order?
A: I'm really hungry. What are my choices?
B: There should be a menu in your room.
A: I have it in front of me. Can I have a cheeseburger deluxe with bacon and fries?
B: Sure. How do you want your burger?
A: Bloody, and I want my bacon extra crispy.
B: Would you like anything to drink?
A: Can I have a beer?
B: Are you 21 or older?
A: I'm way older than 21.
B: We'll send that to your room in 30 minutes. You can pay upon delivery or we can charge your room.



A: Why do you have so many full trash bags?
B: I had a party last night. I'm cleaning up now and tossing them away.
A: Wait! What are you doing?
B: Throwing these bags into the trash can. Why do you seem concerned?
A: Did you divide the recyclables from the trash?
B: No, I didn't. I was a bit lazy to do so.
A: Don't be lazy. You should do your part in helping the environment.
B: You're right. It's going to be messy though. Mind giving me a hand?
A: Sure. I'd be glad to.
B: Thank you. This is a lot to handle alone.
A: Don't mention it. After all, one person can make a big difference to the environment.
B: I'll be sure to be more considerate next time.



A: How may I help you?
B: My computer is not letting me run JavaScript.
A: That can easily be fixed.
B: I've tried fixing it myself, but nothing worked.
A: If you'd kindly go to our website, I'll fix the problem.
B: I've logged in, now what?
A: I will now access your computer from my location.
B: Oh, I see what you are doing.
A: That should just about fix the problem!
B: Thank you so much! It was such an easy solution.
A: I'm happy to help.
B: Again, thank you and have a good day!



A: What's wrong? You seem unsure about something.
B: I'm unsure of where to get off the bus.
A: Where are you coming from?
B: I got on the bus in Pasadena.
A: Where are you heading to?
B: I'm trying to go downtown.
A: I could tell you where to get off.
B: You can? That would be very nice of you. Thank you.
A: I'm happy to help a stranger anytime.
B: What's the street that I should get off on?
A: You're going to get off on Wilshire.
B: How much further is that stop?
A: The bus is fifteen minutes away from there.
B: We're pretty close then.



A: Here comes our food. I'm so hungry. It looks delicious.
B: Here's your order.
A: Excuse me, but I don't think this order is correct.
B: Really? What did you order?
A: I ordered the fried chicken. This is grilled.
B: Let me check. Oh yes, you did order the fried chicken.
A: Yes, I did. Thank you.
B: Not to worry. I'll get your order out in no time.
A: Please do. Two of us would like to eat at the same time.
B: If you like, I can keep your plate warm while preparing her meal.



A: Hello, may I speak to Susan, please?
B: Yes, this is Susan.
A: This is Mr. Jones from the ABC Company.
B: Hello, Mr. Jones.
A: I have a job offer if you are still interested.
B: Oh, that's wonderful. Is it for the customer service job?
A: Yes, we would like you to start next Monday. It pays $15 per hour.
B: Next Monday? Sure. I'll take it.
A: Super. I'll email you some literature you can read about our company.
B: Oh, that's great news, Mr. Jones.
A: Welcome to the ABC Company. We'll see you Monday.
B: Okay, Monday it is. See you then.



A: I love playing all of these old fashioned games!
B: Me, too! Too bad it's so expensive.
A: I wish they'd cost nickels instead of quarters.
B: I think that would lose the arcade a lot of money.
A: Maybe, but it would get them a lot of new customers.
B: Despite the high cost, these games are a lot of fun.
A: Look at these old graphics!
B: It's funny to think they were once considered high-tech.
A: I used to be really good at this game when I was a kid.
B: My brother and I used to compete all the time.
A: Let's see who gets a higher score!
B: Maybe tomorrow. I'm already out of quarters.



A: What can you tell me about the neighborhood?
B: Only good things.
A: Like what, for example?
B: The neighborhood is a safe and clean place.
A: Is there any crime?
B: There is hardly any crime that is reported.
A: I wonder why that is.
B: There is a neighborhood watch that patrols daily.
A: That explains crime disparity.
B: Any other questions?
A: Who are the residents living in the neighborhood?
B: Mostly families and some retired folks.
A: Sounds like a pleasant neighborhood.
B: It really is. I hope you enjoy living there.



A: Can I have you license and registration, sir?
B: What seems to be the problem, officer?
A: You have no idea why I pulled you over?
B: I don't have any idea, officer.
A: You were going 60 miles an hour and the speed limit is only 45.
B: Sorry, officer. I guess I was in a rush.
A: Where are you rushing to?
B: I'm late picking up my kids from school.
A: I'm going to have to give you a ticket.
B: Can't you just let me off with a warning? I'll be more careful next time.
A: You could have caused an accident and never made it to get your kids.
B: You have a point, officer.



A: I can't believe the coffee maker broke!
B: Well, it was a pretty old model.
A: I guess it did last quite a few years.
B: We should buy a new one.
A: Do you want to buy the same model?
B: Maybe it's time we upgrade.
A: What do you mean by that?
B: Well, now we can buy a better coffee maker.
A: What did you have in mind?
B: Maybe something with more functions!
A: I would really like an expresso maker.
B: It's settled, then! We'll buy a new coffee maker!



A: I'm calling to see if the results of some tests I took are in?
B: I can check for you. Can I have your name, please?
A: Sure, my name is Willie Foster.
B: Mr. Foster, your doctor is Dr. Edwards?
A: Yes, that's right.
B: Can you tell me when the tests were taken?
A: I was there last week.
B: I see your results are in, Mr. Foster.
A: Great! Can you read them to me?
B: Actually I cannot. You need to come in and see the doctor.
A: Are they that bad? Am I dying?
B: Sir, I'm just the receptionist. Why don't you come and speak to Dr. Edwards?



A: Hi Katy, this is John.
B: Oh, hey. How are you?
A: I'm great. I wanted to thank you for going out with me last Friday.
B: I'm glad you had a good time.
A: You didn't seem to enjoy it that much.
B: To be honest, I didn't like the movie you picked.
A: I thought a horror movie would be a great way for us to get close to each other.
B: You were a little too hands on.
A: Why don't we try again next weekend?
B: I really don't think so.
A: Are you interested in going out with me again at all?
B: You should probably lose my number.



A: Hi, I'm calling from room 117, and there is a big problem.
B: I'm so sorry. What seems to be the issue?
A: The issue is a huge disgusting cockroach in my bathroom.
B: Is it just one cockroach?
A: Yeah, there is only one, but it's the size of my hand!
B: Why don't you just kill it?
A: I shouldn't have to kill cockroaches while I'm on vacation.
B: Do you want me to send someone to kill it for you?
A: You can send someone, but I also want to be moved to a different room.
B: I don't know if we have any other rooms available right now.
A: Well, I'm not staying in this room if there are gigantic roaches sharing it with me.
B: I'll send someone to your room right away to see if we can move you.



A: You are allowed two carry-on items on this flight.
B: Can I bring on this suitcase?
A: It looks smaller than 45 inches, so it should fit in the overhead compartment.
B: I don't want to put my computer bag in the overhead though.
A: The laptop bag can go underneath the seat in front of you.
B: It's cold in Buffalo, so can I bring my coat?
A: Your coat doesn't count as a carry-on.
B: I have a separate bag with a tuna sandwich I just bought.
A: The bag of food doesn't count as a carry-on.
B: This pillow doesn't fit in my bag either and I need it for the flight.
A: You can bring a pillow or blanket, too.
B: I forgot my blanket at home.



A: Now, you can only check out this magazine for one week.
B: Why one week? I thought the borrowing time was two weeks.
A: That's for books only.
B: Oh, that's weird.
A: Well, it doesn't take that long to finish a magazine.
B: I know, but I like to take my time.
A: I don't make the rules. Would you like to check it out?
B: Yes, I'd like to check it out.
A: Interesting magazine choice. Reading about celebrities is not really smart of you.
B: Don't judge me. I can't read educational stuff all the time.
A: I do! I read Time and National Geographic.
B: Everyone's taste is different.



A: I'm so bad at picking out gifts for my husband.
B: The eternal question of what to get for the man who has everything.
A: What do you suggest?
B: Well, is your husband into sports?
A: He is a huge fan of both soccer and American football.
B: Well, the football season is about to start. How about a jersey from his favorite team?
A: That's actually a great idea.
B: Just tell me what size he is.
A: He's really tall but slim.
B: How about a large then?
A: If it doesn't fit, can I return it?
B: I'll include a gift receipt so he can return it, too.



A: I have a new co-worker at work. She's pretty.
B: Oh, yeah? Is she prettier than your ex-girlfriend?
A: Yeah, she is. She's tall, thin, and wears glasses.
B: Oh, boy. What is it with you and girls with glasses?
A: You know what? I don't know.
B: Well, tell me about her.
A: She likes music. She is always wearing band t-shirts.
B: Really? Are they any bands you like?
A: Yeah, actually a lot of them are.
B: How does she act? Is she nice?
A: She is. I dropped my wallet, and didn't notice. She took it to me.
B: Well, ask her out tomorrow, or somebody will.



A: It's time to go, Richard.
B: Okay, Patty. I'm ready.
A: I'm really stoked about this new school. Judy is going to love it.
B: I know. I've heard so many good things about it.
A: Did you make an appointment?
B: No, it wasn't necessary. They're enrolling new students this week.
A: Okay, I just hope there're not too many people.
B: I think we'll be okay. There're not too many cars in the lot.
A: I'm glad we brought her transcripts. I think that will make this smoother.
B: Yes, I'm sure it will. That was a good idea.
A: Okay, let's get this done.
B: I'm ready, babe.



A: I'm sorry for being difficult.
B: Not at all. We aim to please.
A: It's just that this will be my family's home. It has to be right.
B: I understand completely.
A: So where is this next home?
B: It's nearby. I think this is the one.
A: I truly hope so.
B: This is it.
A: Wow! I like it.
B: I thought you might.
A: Is this in my price range? If it is, I think I just found my house.
B: It definitely is. Let's go inside.



A: How are you doing?
B: Good! What's going on?
A: Not too much. I'm on my way to the EDD.
B: Wait a minute. I thought you found a job last month.
A: I did. I'm not going there to file a claim.
B: Then why are you heading out there?
A: The EDD is hiring, that's why.
B: Wow! That's awesome. That's a very good place to work.
A: I know. That's why I'm going.
B: The pay is good, and the benefits are excellent.
A: Yes, my sister works there.
B: Good luck to you. I may have to go there myself now.



A: After seeing your college application, I can tell you're really smart and talented.
B: Not really, I'm lying about almost everything.
A: Why?! They're going to find out.
B: No, they're not! They're not going to check.
A: Yes, they will. After a college admits you, they'll ask for your transcript.
B: I didn't know that! How about my extracurriculars?
A: They'll randomly audit 10% of their applicants.
B: What does that mean?
A: The UCs will randomly select 10% of their applicants to provide proof of their extracurriculars. 
B: It's only 10%.
A: It's not that little! You may be chosen. Be careful. 
B: You're right. It's too risky to lie.



A: Hello? I'd like to schedule an appointment.
B: Hello! What time would you like to come in?
A: Well, I only like Jane cutting my hair.
B: Jane comes in to work at 3 p.m. today.
A: That sounds perfect! Sign me up.
B: You'll be coming in for a haircut, yes?
A: I'd also like to redo my highlights.
B: That will be no problem. Can I have your name?
A: My name is Sarah.
B: Alright, Sarah, we'll be expecting you!
A: Alright, thank you!
B: See you soon!



A: Good morning, Alice. Today's the big day!
B: Yes, it is. Are we ready for this?
A: I think so. You know I've been working on the house.
B: I know, Richard. I guess I'm just nervous.
A: I wouldn't worry, babe. We've worked very hard on this.
B: Yes. I know, but still ...
A: We cleaned the house, spruced up the yard, and painted the interior.
B: I know, Richard. I'm worried about the things we didn't do.
A: I think we'll be okay. If something comes up, we'll deal with it then.
B: You think of everything.
A: No. I don't, Alice. We think of everything.
B: You're right. We'll be ready.



A: What is that you're eating?
B: It's a house salad.
A: What order are you waiting for?
B: Oh, I'm not waiting for an order to come.
A: You mean that's all the lunch you're having?
B: Yes, this is my lunch today.
A: Are you on a diet?
B: No, I just felt like eating a salad.
A: It's only got lettuce!
B: No. It has cucumbers and carrots, too.
A: What's that on the top?
B: Steamed chicken. It's delicious!



A: How many miles does the car have?
B: It has 55,150 miles on it.
A: Let's take it around the block, see what this baby has.
B: Sure thing. Here are the keys.
A: The air-conditioning doesn't work?
B: No, it does not. It's an easy fix though.
A: Okay. Are there any other problems with it?
B: Everything should be in order.
A: The power steering seems to need some fixing.
B: Why do you say that?
A: It's hard to turn the steering wheel when turning.
B: You may take it to a mechanic to make sure.



A: Do you know where I could dispose of my trash?
B: Yeah, there are two different colored trash cans in the back.
A: Is there a difference between the two?
B: Well, one is for recycling and the other is for trash.
A: Can you tell me which color is the one for recycling?
B: That would be the blue trash can.
A: And the black trash can is for regular trash?
B: Yes, that is correct.
A: On what day does the garbage truck come by to pick up the trash?
B: It comes every Thursday.
A: Thank you for your help. Take care.
B: Sure. Don't mention it.



A: May I turn in my homework tomorrow?
B: It's due today.
A: I know, but I don't have it right now.
B: How come? Your dog ate it?
A: No! I left it at home.
B: I can't take your word for it.
A: Why not? I'm an A+ student.
B: How do I know if you even did the homework?
A: I'll ask my mom to take a picture of it and send it to me.
B: That's fair enough.
A: Thanks. Also, you should try trusting students more. We're not all that bad.
B: I'll try, but I can't promise anything.



A: I wonder what I can do to get involved in the campaign?
B: You can volunteer.
A: What does a campaign volunteer do?
B: All kinds of things like handing out pamphlets.
A: Pamphlets about what?
B: About the candidate and what they stand for.
A: That sounds like it would be a great way to meet people.
B: It is. Volunteers also make phone calls and ask for money.
A: I would feel awkward asking strangers for money.
B: It's not for you. It's for your candidate.
A: You have a point.
B: Volunteering for a campaign is a great experience.



A: Is this your first time riding the bus?
B: Yes, it is. How did you tell?
A: The look on your face gave it away.
B: I really do look that confused?
A: I'm sorry to say so, but don't be embarrassed.
B: You seem friendly. Would you mind answering a question?
A: No, not at all. What's your question?
B: I'm trying to get to the airport. Do you know where I should get off?
A: This bus actually drops you off right in front of the airport.
B: I know that it does. I've just forgotten on what street.
A: The stop will say LAX Airport.
B: Oh, really. That's pretty obvious.



A: Excuse me. This is my first time on campus. Where can I park?
B: There are three parking lots on campus.
A: Can you point me to the direction of the nearest one?
B: Keep driving straight. When you get to the light, make a left.
A: Thank you. Do I have to pay?
B: The first floor has visitors parking.
A: So, do I have to pay? Do they take credit cards?
B: Yes, you would have to pay, and they do take credit cards.
A: How much does it cost to park?
B: I believe it is $3. I could be wrong.
A: Oh, okay. Thank you very much.
B: You're welcome. Have a nice day.



A: Were you invited to Leslie's birthday party dinner?
B: I was. I'm really excited about it.
A: Would you like to go with me?
B: Do you mean as your date?
A: Yeah, why not? You and I have been out a few times together.
B: This will be the first time we go out in front of friends though.
A: Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?
B: Not at all. It will be really nice though.
A: I'll pick you up at 8:00 then?
B: Why not 7:30?
A: Why so early?
B: It will give us time to pick up a bottle of wine on our way.



A: Good morning, Mr. Davis.
B: Good morning, Rudy. How are you today?
A: I'm doing well, thanks.
B: So, what have you got for me today?
A: I have exciting news, Mr. Davis.
B: What is it? Did someone make an offer?
A: Yes. I have a serious offer on your house. This may be the one.
B: How close to the asking price is the offer?
A: Very close. The offer is at $325,000.
B: Wow. That's great. That's almost what we listed it for.
A: There are a couple of conditions though, but they're not too bad.
B: Okay, I'm all ears. Let's go over them. I'm ready to sell.



A: I have to tell you something.
B: What is it?
A: You graded my test incorrectly. I got this wrong, but you didn't mark it.
B: Wow! I have never met a more honest student.
A: I just felt wrong.
B: Just keep the score you have.
A: Really? That's awesome.
B: Yes. I have to ask, why did you decide to tell me?
A: I'm really bad at lying.
B: That's a good thing! Your honesty is praiseworthy.
A: Thanks. Want to give me extra credit?
B: Don't push it.



A: I have a few questions regarding the neighborhood.
B: Alright, let's hear them.
A: Does the neighborhood look good aesthetically?
B: Yes, very much so.
A: That's good news. Can you describe how?
B: The neighborhood is abundant with plant life.
A: You mean like trees and bushes?
B: Yes, and not just any regular trees and bushes. The ones here are beautiful.
A: Anything else you can describe?
B: Yes. The streets are nicely paved, and the street lights are quite quaint.
A: Wow, I could just picture it now.
B: The neighborhood will look even better in person.



A: Open the door, police.
B: What's going on?
A: We have a warrant for your arrest.
B: What's the charge?
A: You are being arrested for robbery.
B: I didn't rob anyone.
A: Tell it to the judge. Turn around, please.
B: I know my rights!
A: You have the right to remain silent.
B: How about my right to a lawyer?
A: You can call your attorney after we process you.
B: I'm not saying anything else until I speak to a lawyer.



A: Hello, this is Isabel Foster.
B: Hi, Isabel. Why are you calling? You can just come to my office.
A: I'm actually not in the office right now.
B: You aren't? Well, why not? Is everything okay?
A: Actually everything is not okay. I'm pretty sick.
B: I'm sorry to hear that.
A: I'm not going to make it into the office today.
B: There's no way you can come in, just finish that report?
A: If I come in, I may give everyone what I have.
B: Well, what do you have?
A: I have a really bad stomach flu.
B: Eww yeah, in that case, stay home.



A: There're a few problems with room 217, and I'd liked to be moved.
B: Maybe it's a problem we can fix without moving you.
A: If you can kill the 8 cockroaches I've seen this morning.
B: Did you say 8 cockroaches? Are you exaggerating just a little?
A: I know how to count and I took pictures and video with my cell phone.
B: We can call an exterminator and send him to your room.
A: Great, and then I'm supposed to breathe in toxins after that?
B: At least you won't have any more roaches.
A: You can't be serious right now. Can I speak to your supervisor?
B: I can transfer your call right now.
A: Can you also transfer my room?
B: I'll check to see if we have any vacant rooms we can move you to.



A: How long do you want to check that video out for?
B: One week would be nice.
A: That will be $5.
B: What?! I thought I could check out videos for free.
A: You can check out educational videos for free.
B: This is bogus.
A: It's still not a bad price.
B: Okay, what if I only borrow it for a day?
A: It will be $2.
B: Okay, here's $2. So much for a library that services the public.
A: I hope you enjoy the movie.
B: For 2 bucks, I'd better love the movie.



A: I'm registering for Psych 21, because I need it to transfer.
B: I need that class too in order to transfer.
A: But there's only one space left!
B: That's terrible. My registration time is at 5 p.m.
A: Darn it! Mine is at 6 p.m. 
B: That sucks. Maybe someone will drop out.
A: I doubt it. Psych 21 is needed by a lot of people.
B: Beg the professor?
A: If I have to.
B: You should cry! That might work.
A: I'm planning to. I can cry on demand.
B: Maybe you should take a theater class instead.



A: This bus is taking so long!
B: You're right. It's running late.
A: It was supposed to be here thirty minutes ago.
B: Just be a little more patient. I'm sure it'll arrive any minute now.
A: We're going to be so late, all because of this late bus.
B: The buses usually come on time.
A: They should always be on time. Don't they know people depend on their swiftness?
B: Just wait a little longer.
A: I'm tired of waiting. This bus is never going to come.
B: Complaining is not helping the situation.
A: I have every right to be complaining!
B: Suit yourself then.



A: What do you think I should get for dessert?
B: I don't know, look at the menu.
A: Wow! They have icecream, pies, cakes.
B: It looks like a great selection!
A: I don't know what to get!
B: It's kind of hot out. Maybe icecream would be good.
A: Icecream sounds fantastic!
B: How about we go to the icecream parlor down the street?
A: That sounds good to me! Let's go.
B: That pecan pie is calling my name, though.
A: Answer to icecream's call only!
B: You're right! Let's go!



A: Can you give me a ride to the airport tomorrow?
B: Depends on what time you need to be at the airport.
A: Well, my flight leaves at 10:30 in the morning.
B: Did you check in online already?
A: Yes, I checked in and I don't have any bags to check.
B: So we should leave by 9:00, so you can be there by 9:30.
A: It's an international flight.
B: Oh, so you need to be there two hours before your flight.
A: Can you get me to the airport by 8:30?
B: That's when I take the kids to school, so no.
A: So how am I going to get to the airport then?
B: Guess you'll have to pay for a cab.



A: I heard that your brother is in the hospital.
B: Yeah. He's been there since last week.
A: Oh, no. What happened? Is he alright?
B: He got in a car accident. He should be alright.
A: The doctors told you he would be alright?
B: Yes, but they need to keep him for further tests.
A: Oh, okay. I was so worried when I heard this.
B: Thanks, but everything should be fine. He was lucky.
A: Really lucky. Did anyone else get injured?
B: His girlfriend broke her arm, but that's all.
A: Oh, that's not good. Is she at the hospital?
B: Yes, she is taking care of my brother.



A: Sir, is this your car?
B: Yes, are you giving me a ticket?
A: Unfortunately, yes, I am. Read the sign.
B: Which sign? I don't see a sign.
A: The sign above you, sir.
B: So, what? It says that we can't park on Mondays.
A: Yes, it does. Although, it also says that you can't park without a permit.
B: I didn't see that.
A: Well, I'm sorry, but I still have to give you the ticket.
B: Can't you just give me a warning?
A: I'm sorry, but I already started writing the ticket.
B: Fine. Give me the ticket. I'll fight it in court.



A: Thank you for coming to my party this evening.
B: No, thank you for letting me come as my cousin's guest.
A: Any relative of Tina is welcome in my home. Have a seat.
B: Thank you. You two know each other for a long time?
A: We have. Can I get you something to drink?
B: A glass of water will be fine.
A: Would you like that with or without ice?
B: Without ice is fine.
A: We also have a buffet out back.
B: Could you show me the way?
A: Sure just follow me. I think your cousin is out back.
B: You really have a lovely home.



A: I need to get to the airport by 6 o'clock.
B: That's in less than 45 minutes. You'll never make it.
A: I have to try. I was hoping to get the shuttle home.
B: Why did you wait so long?
A: It was my boss. He kept us late.
B: Well, there goes a taxi.
A: Taxi! Taxi! Darn, someone else got it.
B: You're going to have a hard time getting a taxi at this hour.
A: I know, but what can I do? Taxi!
B: Well, good luck, George. I'm taking the subway.
A: Okay, have a good weekend. Taxi!



A: Good day, Ms. Andrews. Can we talk?
B: Of course, Mr. Johnson. Why don't you come into the office this afternoon?
A: That would be fine.
B: What's on your mind, Mr. Johnson?
A: I want to make an offer on the 1st Avenue home.
B: That's great. I'll see you at 2 p.m.
A: Hello, Ms. Andrews.
B: Hello, Mr. Johnson. You're right on time.
A: I like to be prompt, Ms. Andrews.
B: That's great. I appreciate that.
A: I'm ready to make an offer.
B: Okay, let's get started.



A: Honey, this steak looks delicious.
B: Yes, it does, Michael. It has a nice color.
A: Yum, and it's perfectly cooked.
B: It looks a bit rare. How did you order it?
A: Medium-rare, as always.
B: That looks rare to me, dear.
A: It might be a bit pink on the inside, but I don't care. This is delicious.
B: That's all that matters, dear.
A: I have to tell the waiter to send my compliments to the chef.
B: That would be a nice gesture.
A: The baked potato is also very tasty.
B: Well, make sure you tell the chef that also.



A: Can you cut my hair a little differently this time?
B: Sure! How would you like it cut?
A: Well, last time it was a little too long.
B: I see what you mean. How about a bob cut?
A: Can you work some layers into it?
B: Of course! It's easy.
A: I would also like to keep some bangs.
B: How long would you like them?
A: Maybe down to my eyebrows?
B: Sounds good!
A: I trust you to make me look beautiful.
B: Oh, trust me, you'll look gorgeous!



A: I don't think I'd like to be famous.
B: Why not? It seems like a good lifestyle.
A: There would always be paparazzi following me everywhere.
B: I guess that would be really annoying.
A: It would be impossible to get any peace and quiet.
B: Not to mention the lack of privacy.
A: I'd love to be in an action movie, though!
B: Why do you want to be in an action movie?
A: Then I could say that I was a superhero!
B: I don't think anyone would believe that you're a superhero.
A: They would if I was in an action movie!
B: Like I said before, that's never going to happen.



A: Excuse me, sir. How much for this lamp?
B: I'll sell it to you for $50.
A: Oh, no! That's way too expensive.
B: What price did you have in mind?
A: Maybe something closer to one fourth that much.
B: I might as well give it away for that price!
A: What about half?
B: That's still not enough of a profit.
A: I'll give you $30 for it.
B: Make it $35 and you've got a deal.
A: Alright, that sounds good to me.
B: You sure drive a hard bargain!



A: I checked the whole car, and it has some problems.
B: What kind of problems does it have?
A: The brakes need to be replaced, as well as the power steering.
B: Is that all? That seems like an easy fix.
A: That's not all. The alternator seems to be malfunctioning.
B: How much would it cost me to fix it all?
A: It'll cost around $300 to $400.
B: That's not too bad. Is there anything else?
A: From what I can tell, no. I would recommend buying it.
B: Let me call the seller, and I will let you know if you can start.
A: Great. I can start right away, if he gives you the thumbs up.
B: He said that it's fine. I will be back for the car when you're done.



A: Hello.
B: Hi, baby, it's Joe.
A: What's up, honey?
B: I just got off work. What are you doing tonight?
A: I don't have any plans. I'll be getting home at about 6:00.
B: Well, I got a hold of some Dodger tickets for tonight.
A: How did you manage that?
B: A friend at work was selling them. He couldn't go himself.
A: That's great! Who are they playing?
B: They're playing the Giants. It should be a good game.
A: Alright then, count me in.
B: Okay, I'll pick you up at 6:30.



A: Hello, my name is George.
B: Hello, George. How can I help you?
A: I'm trying to file a claim online, but I have questions.
B: Okay, give me a moment and I'll go over there to help you.
A: Hello again. Thanks for coming over.
B: It's my pleasure. What are you having trouble with?
A: It's this question here. I'm not sure what it is asking for.
B: The system is asking for the reason you are no longer working.
A: Does that make a difference?
B: Yes it does. We review every person's case individually.
A: My company went out of business.
B: Then just put "Company out of business." You should be okay.



A: Hello, neighbor. I just moved into the apartments last week. I have a question.
B: Sure. What do you need to know?
A: I need to locate the laundry room. I have a load of clothes to wash.
B: There is one downstairs.
A: Thank you very much.
B: There is also another located in the basement of the neighboring building.
A: Do I have to pay at a front desk?
B: No, the machines require exact change. I suggest you take quarters.
A: Does the laundry room carry detergent?
B: Yes, but I recommend you take your own. They're expensive.
A: That's good to know. Thanks again and have a nice day.
B: No problem. See you around.



A: I'm really excited about my short-term job.
B: What's so great about it?
A: I'll be working at a polling place.
B: What do you do at that job?
A: I'll help to make sure voters are voting at the right place and answer basic questions.
B: Was the job hard to get?
A: Not really. I filled out an application online.
B: That's all you had to do?
A: There was a mandatory training too, but they paid me for that.
B: Does it pay well?
A: It pays better than the minimum wage.
B: Maybe I'll become a poll worker, too.
