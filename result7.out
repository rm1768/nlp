CAROL: Sure. That's so kind of you.
HELEN: Come around 7 pm. Bob will be home by then.
CAROL: Thanks! What can I bring tonight?
HELEN: How about some sun after you get back from the Bahamas? It's so cold here these days.
CAROL: I wish I could.
Doug:  Ron is driving me crazy!
Lou:  Why?
Doug:  He has an annoying habit of tapping his fingernails on the desk.
Lou:  Have you told him to stop?
Doug:  No.  I don't want to be rude.
Lou:  Well, if it's making you crazy, you need to tell him.
Janice:  I think the managers are discussing our annual raises.
Debbie:  Don't get your hopes too high.
Janice:  Why?
Debbie:  Business has not been good lately.
Janice:  Employees still deserve raises.  We work hard.
Debbie:  Probably not hard enough to our managers.
Polly:  During my review, my boss asked me what my goals are.
Tori:  What did you say?
Polly:  I told her I didn't know.
Tori:  That's not a very good answer.
Polly:  I know.  She probably thinks I have no goals for my future.
Tori:  I thought you had plans to go back to school and get a degree.
Polly:  That is my plan.
Tori:  I thought you wanted a degree so you can apply for better paying positions in the company.
Polly:  You're right.
Tori:  Then why didn't you tell her these things?
Polly:  I got nervous and couldn't talk.
BETTY: Hey Nancy, why do you look so worried?
NANCY: Oh, hi Betty. Christine and I had a big argument and she has decided to move out.
BETTY: What did you argue about?
NANCY: I told her that she needs to help clean up around the apartment.
BETTY: What happened after you told her that?
NANCY: She got upset and said she is moving out. But it's the truth. She never helps around house.
BETTY: Yeah, that could be a problem.
NANCY: I had to say something since we're roommates and I'm tired of cleaning her mess.
BETTY: I totally understand. I like things neat and organized too.
NANCY: But the bigger problem is that she never pays her rent on time. She is late every month.
BETTY: What are you going to do?
NANCY: I need to find a roommate soon. I can't afford the rent by myself. Do you know anyone looking for a roommate?
BETTY: Yes, I do.
NANCY: Who?
BETTY: Me.
NANCY: That would be awesome!
Nicole:  Dan, we're excited to start working with you.
Dan:  Should we set up a meeting to discuss the details of the work?
Nicole:  Yes.  That's a good idea.
Dan:  When are you free?
Nicole:  How about next Tuesday?
Dan:  I have an all-day meeting on Tuesday.  What about Wednesday?
Nicole:  I'm on a business trip on Wednesday.  I will be back Friday morning.
Dan:  Friday works for me.  Should we do a lunch meeting?
Nicole:  Sure.  I'll put it in my calendar.
Dan:   Have a good business trip and I'll see you next Friday.
Daniel:  I need help with negotiating.
Nathan:  What do you want to negotiate?
Daniel:  I want to change some of the terms in a contract.
Nathan:  First of all, don't be afraid to ask for what you want.
Daniel:  What else?
Nathan:  Be willing to say no if you're not happy.
Diana:  How are the kids doing?
Cathy:  They are so busy with sports.
Diana:  What do they play?
Cathy:  Jenny plays softball and Luke plays baseball.
Diana:  You must be busy with games.
Cathy:  There are games every weekend.  
Diana:  Isn't it fun to watch?
Cathy:  It is so much fun to watch and cheer the teams on.
Diana:  I miss those days.  My kids are all in college now.
Cathy:  Time is too short.
DANIEL: Dad, can we get a dog?
DAD: Daniel, are we talking about this again?
DANIEL: You promised we could get one when I got older.
DAD: Having a dog is a big responsibility.
DANIEL: I know. I promise to help take care of it.
DAD: You have to walk him, feed him, bathe him, clean his messes, and play with him.
DANIEL: I promise to do all of those things.
DAD: I need to talk to your mom first.
DANIEL: But mom doesn't want a dog. She doesn't like them.
DAD: It's because she is afraid of them.
DANIEL: Why is she afraid of dogs?
DAD: She was bitten by a dog when she was a child.
DANIEL: Oh, I see. But if we get a puppy, we can train it not to bite.
DAD: That's true.
DANIEL: Dad, did you have a dog when you were a kid?
DAD: Yes. But I was old enough to help take care of him.
DANIEL: How old were you?
DAD: Ten years old.
DANIEL: Dad, I'm eleven years old.
LISA: Hey James, I'm thinking about asking the boss for a promotion.
JAMES: Lisa, you definitely deserve a promotion. You are too qualified for this job.
LISA: Really? You think so?
JAMES: You have a lot of experience and you're very good with people. You should be a manager.
LISA: That's the position I was going to ask for, but I was worried.
JAMES: What are you worried about?
LISA: I don't have a college degree. You have to have a college degree for that position.
JAMES: But you have lots of experience. You have more experience than some of the current managers.
LISA: I know, but degrees are important too.
JAMES: I know they are. Did you ever think about going back to school and getting your degree?
LISA: I have, but I am so busy these days. I don't have time to work and study.
JAMES: I understand. When I'm not at work, I'm spending time with my family. Life is so busy these days for many people.
LISA: That's true. I'm not married yet, but I take care of my elderly parents.
JAMES: That's a lot of work too.
LISA: Yeah. Well, thanks for your support. I'll let you know what happens.
SARAH: Hey Ted, why do you look so nervous?
TED: I'm going to ask the boss for a raise.
SARAH: You should. You deserve a raise. You work very hard.
TED: I do work hard. I'm here early every day and I leave late every night.
SARAH: Yeah, you do. You also help other people when they need help. You've helped me many times.
TED: Also, I've been here for 10 years. My last raise was three years ago.
SARAH: Three years? Then I think it's definitely time for a raise.
TED: Do you think she will say yes?
SARAH: I think she will. She is nice. She listens well and she is also very fair.
TED: I wrote a short report about why I deserve a raise.
SARAH: Only you would do that. You are so detail-oriented.
TED: I like to be prepared about everything.
SARAH: That's another reason why you should get a raise.
TED: Ok. I'm ready to talk to her?
SARAH: You can't talk to her today.
TED: Why not?
SARAH: She's on a business trip.
PHIL: I need a vacation.
KAREN: What's wrong?
PHIL: This job is so stressful, Karen!
KAREN: I think you should ask the boss for some time off?
PHIL: I can't right now. I have a big presentation on Friday.
KAREN: Take a break next week after the presentation.
PHIL: I have another project after this one.
KAREN: You need to make a change. You're going to get sick.
PHIL: I know. But I have a lot of responsibilities.
KAREN: I know you do. But you also have to take care of yourself too.
PHIL: You're right. I need to talk to the boss and tell him that I need a vacation. Do you think he will understand?
KAREN: I think so. He had a heart attack a few years ago. He understands that health is very important.
PHIL: Ok. I will talk to him today. Thanks for your advice.
KAREN: You're welcome. Where do you plan to go on vacation?
PHIL: A nice, warm beach.
KAREN: That sounds great!
Frank:  What was the boss talking about?
Andrew:  Weren't you listening?
Frank:  Yes.  But, I didn't quite understand what he meant.
Andrew:  He said no one is getting a raise this year.
Frank:  That's ridiculous.
Andrew:  I know.  The managers are all getting bonuses.
Frank:  The company made a profit too.
Andrew:  I don't know what's going on.
Frank:  I'm going to ask for a clear explanation.
Andrew:  Good luck.  You may lose your job.
Mike:  Would you like to go out to dinner this Saturday?
Phoebe:  No, thank you.  I already have plans.

Mike:  You have a busy schedule.
Phoebe:  Yes, I do.
A: Hi Alice. What are you doing here?
B: Hi Linda. I'm here for a check-up. How about you?
A: I'm here for a procedure.
B: What kind of procedure?
A: A root canal.
B: A root canal? That's pretty serious, isn't it?
A: Yeah. I didn't take care of a tooth and now it's infected.
B: Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you in pain?
A: A little. I took some medicine this morning.
B: That should help.
A: I don't have dental insurance, so it's going to be very expensive.
B: That's terrible. Why don't you have dental insurance?
A: I didn't think it was important.
B: I think it's important to have dental insurance.
A: Yeah. And it's important to take care of your teeth.
B: I agree.
A: Hi. How can I help you?
B: I need to mail this package to Italy.
A: What is in the package?
B: Some toys and baby clothes.
A: Are there any breakables? Is it fragile?
B: No.
A: What is the address?
B: I have it here.
A: Please fill out this form. Print clearly. Sometimes, it is hard to read.
B: Ok. When will my package arrive?
A: It depends on your shipping choice.
B: I would like your fastest shipping.
A: It will be there in one week.
B: Great! That's perfect.
A: This is the cost. How would you like to pay?
B: With my credit card.
A: Ok. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
B: No. That's it.
A: Thank you. Have a nice day.
B: You too.
Chris:  Our new client is having a party at his house.
Dennis:  Are you going?
Chris:  No.  I don't like him.
Dennis:  Why?
Chris:  He makes inappropriate comments.
Dennis:  What kind of comments?
Chris:  Rude comments about people.
Dennis:  Why is our company working with him then?
Chris:  He's our boss's friend.
Dennis:  Our boss is wimp.
DAN: Hey Jason. Is that a new car?
JASON: Hey Dan. No, this is a rental car?
DAN: Where is your car?
JASON: At the auto shop. I was in an accident yesterday. The car is getting repaired.
DAN: Are you ok?
JASON: Yeah. Luckily, it wasn't a serious accident. There were just some minor damages to the fender and bumper.
DAN: That's good. When do you get your car back?
JASON: It's supposed to be ready this afternoon.
DAN: That's quick.
JASON: Yeah, my auto shop is pretty fast. They have a lot of mechanics.
DAN: Do they do a good job? Are they reasonably priced?
JASON: Oh yes. They do a great job. I haven't had any problems yet. They're a little more expensive than other places, but their work and service is excellent.
DAN: I may have to get their name and number. My car needs some regular maintenance work.
JASON: They have a website. Sometimes, they offer discounts on certain services.
DAN: Really? That's good to know.
JASON: Yeah. I'll e-mail you the website link.
DAN: Thanks. I'll check it out tonight.
Dave:  How's the presentation going?
Jack:  Good.  
Dave:  Can you give us some information about it?
Jack:  I don't have time.  I need to make a phone call.  
Dave:  Ok.  You look like you're in a hurry.
Jack:  It's important.  It can't wait.  
TOM: Hey Alison. Are you free for dinner tonight?
ALISON: Hi Tom. No, I'm not. I'm babysitting a neighbor's kid.
TOM: What time?
ALISON: From 5 pm to 9 pm.
TOM: What about next Friday?
ALISON: I'm babysitting again next Friday.
TOM: Why are you babysitting so much?
ALISON: It's a good way to make money.
TOM: Do you like children?
ALISON: Yeah, I love kids. They're fun to play with.
TOM: I don't like them. They're noisy and they smell weird.
ALISON: You're so funny. You would make a terrible babysitter.
TOM: You're right. I'd rather babysit dogs.
ALISON: Dogs are noisy and they smell weird too.
TOM: I know. But they're cuter than kids.
ALISON: You're silly.
TOM: Then when are you free for dinner?
ALISON: Tomorrow night.
TOM: OK. I'm free tomorrow too. I'll pick you up at 6 pm at your house.
ALISON: Great! I'll see you then.
Kevin:  I think the company has finally made a profit.
Jordan:  That's great news!
Kevin:  We're all getting raises and bonuses this year.
Jordan:  That makes me very happy.
Kevin:  Me too.  We haven't had raises in four years.  
Jordan:  We've never had bonuses.
Kevin:  That's right!  
Jordan:  If the company is doing well financially, we should definitely receive some benefits.
Kevin:  I agree.  We work really hard.
Jordan:  Let's celebrate over drinks after work.  
KATHY: Hi Jane. What are you doing today?
JANE: Hi Kathy. I'm going back-to-school shopping with the kids.
KATHY: We did that last week.
JANE: Are there any good sales going on?
KATHY: Yeah, the mall is having great sales.
JANE: Good. I need to buy clothes and shoes for my daughter. She has outgrown all of her clothes.
KATHY: Really? My kids are still wearing the same size.
JANE: Jenny grew four inches during the summer.
KATHY: Wow! That's amazing!
JANE: I know. She eats a lot these days.
KATHY: Probably because she is growing. Do you need to buy school supplies, too?
JANE: Yeah, I will be shopping for clothes, shoes, and school supplies today.
KATHY: I'm glad I'm done. The mall was really crowded last week. I think everyone is shopping for school.
JANE: I do not like crowds. We should've done this earlier. We always wait until the last minute every year.
KATHY: Good luck! I hope you find everything you need.
JANE: Thanks. It's going to be a long day.
TED: Hi Bill.
BILL: Hi Ted.
TED: Bill, would you like to come to a backyard barbeque?
BILL: Sure. When?
TED: Tomorrow at 5 o'clock PM.
BILL: Who else is coming?
TED: I invited a few other neighbors.
BILL: What's the occasion?
TED: I got a new outdoor grill and I want to test it out.

TED: Would you like to bring some beverages?
BILL: I can do that.
TED: Great! I'm going to grill some hamburgers and hot dogs.
BILL: That sounds delicious!
TED: Our neighbor, Peter, is going to bring some apple pies.
BILL: This is going to be a great party.
TED: I hope so. I hope my grill works well.
BILL: If it doesn't, we can order pizza!
TED: That's funny. I like pizza too.
BILL: I like hamburgers better.
KAREN: Hi Susan.
SUSAN: Hi Karen.
KAREN: I'm thinking about throwing Bobby a birthday party in the backyard.
SUSAN: That sounds like a great idea. Have you checked the weather?
KAREN: The weather is going to be sunny this weekend.
SUSAN: That's perfect for an outdoor party.
KAREN: I want to do a barbeque and have games.
SUSAN: I can help you.
KAREN: That would be wonderful.
SUSAN: Have you thought of what you want to serve?
KAREN: I want to do something simple like grill hot dogs with potato chips.
SUSAN: I can bake a cake for you.
KAREN: Wow! That is so kind of you. Are you sure?
SUSAN: It would be my pleasure.
KAREN: Can I pay you?
SUSAN: No. It is my gift to Bobby.
KAREN: Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.
SUSAN: Is there anything else I can help you with?
KAREN: No. Baking the birthday cake is plenty.
SUSAN: Ok. Let me know if there is anything else you need.
THOMAS: How was the hotel?
SAM: It was awful. We had to switch rooms a couple of times.
THOMAS: Why?
SAM: Well, we found bugs in the carpet in one room. We had already unpacked. So, we had to re-pack everything and ask for another room.
THOMAS: What was wrong with the second room?
SAM: We paid for a garden room and it was a view of the parking lot.
THOMAS: That's terrible. Did you finally get a good room?
SAM: They were out of garden view rooms, so they upgraded us to an ocean view room.
THOMAS: That's nice! So, why was it so awful?
SAM: Our next door neighbor snored so loudly. He kept us awake every night.
THOMAS: Did you ask for another room?
SAM: Yes, but they said that there were no more rooms available.
THOMAS: I'm sorry you had a terrible time.
SAM: That's ok. The manager was really nice about it. He offered us a free stay next time.
THOMAS: Are you going to go back there?
SAM: Of course. It'll be free.
JOAN: Hey Carol, have you seen Tom lately?
CAROL: Didn't you hear the news?
JOAN: No. What happened?
CAROL: He got into a car accident last week.
JOAN: Is he ok?
CAROL: No. He's in the hospital. He broke both of his legs and ribs. He also has a head injury.
JOAN: That's terrible. I had the flu, so I haven't seen or talked to anyone lately. How's Judy?
CAROL: Judy has come home a couple of times to get a change of clothes.
JOAN: She must be devastated.
CAROL: She is a very worried wife.
JOAN: Have you seen him?
CAROL: Bob and I visited him in the hospital a couple of days ago. He is on so much medication.
JOAN: Wow! That's serious.
CAROL: Yeah.
JOAN: Does Judy know how long he's going to be in the hospital?
CAROL: The doctors told her he may be there for several months.
JOAN: Oh my goodness. What is she going to do?
CAROL: Their children are helping her right now. They're taking turns staying at the hospital.
JOAN: That's good. I better visit him soon. Thanks for the information.
KEVIN: The traffic is really getting bad these days.
JAMES: I agree. I sat in traffic for two hours last night.
KEVIN: I've started to leave work late just to beat rush hour traffic.
JAMES: I wish I could do that. I have to pick up my son before the daycare closes.
KEVIN: Oh, I see. What time does the daycare close?
JAMES: 6 o'clock.
KEVIN: What time do you usually get there?
JAMES: Just a few minutes before they close.
KEVIN: What happens if you're late?
JAMES: They will wait with the child, of course. But you have to pay extra.
KEVIN: Have you ever been late?
JAMES: Yeah, a few times. I was late yesterday. I don't want to pay extra. Daycare is already expensive.
KEVIN: Yeah, I'm sure it is. Do you have other people who can help you?
JAMES: No, I just listen to the traffic report and leave earlier if the roads sound bad.
KEVIN: Is your boss understanding?
JAMES: Yeah, she's very understanding. She has children too.
Julie:  There was a bank robbery downtown.
Sam:  Did anyone get hurt?
Julie:  I don't know yet.
Sam:  Have they caught the robbers?
Julie:  No, the police are looking for them.
Sam:  We better lock our doors.
SAM: I'm taking my son to a baseball game.
JASON: Cool!
SAM: We always watch it on TV, but I wanted him to experience the game in person.
JASON: My son loves going to the games. He loves the hot dogs and cotton candy.
SAM: Yeah, I think my son will be more interested in those things too.
JASON: Where are your seats?
SAM: My boss gave me his season tickets for this game. We're sitting right behind home plate.
JASON: Wow! Those are fantastic seats! You have a nice boss.
SAM: Yes, I do. He has three children. They are all grown up now, but he still takes them to games.
JASON: It's a great time to bond with your children.
SAM: That's what I'm hoping for.
JASON: Are you taking your baseball mitts?
SAM: Yeah. My son wants to take it just in case he catches a foul ball.
JASON: He may. You never know.
SAM: Also, I want to take our mitts so we can get them signed by one of the players.
JASON: That would be amazing. He would probably love that.
SAM: He would be so thrilled.
JASON: Well, have a great time! I'll try to find you on TV.
CHARLIE: Hey Joe. Where are you heading?
JOE: Hey Charlie. I'm meeting some friends at the park. We're going to play basketball.

CHARLIE: I used to play in high school. I was on the school basketball team.

CHARLIE: I can't today. I have to dentist appointment.
JOE: A dentist appointment on a nice day?
CHARLIE: Yeah. It was the only day available.
JOE: What about next weekend? We get together every Saturday at the basketball court in the park.
CHARLIE: Sure. Sounds like fun. What time?
JOE: Same time every Saturday. 10 am.
CHARLIE: Do you think your friends will be ok with a new guy joining?
JOE: Yeah. We could use another player. One guy hurt his knee and won't be able to play for a while.
CHARLIE: Ok. Then I'll see you next Saturday.
JOE: Cool!

SIMON: Cool! Thanks for inviting me.
PHIL: Hey, thanks for dinner.
Ethan:  My client and I are trying to negotiate a new contract.
Aaron:  Be a good listener.  The best way to negotiate is to listen to what the other side says.
Ethan:  You mean just let him talk?
Aaron:  No.  Ask him questions.  You can get a lot of information by asking questions.
Ethan:  That's a good tip.
Aaron:  Many issues can get resolved if we just learn to listen.
Jason:  I'm having a meeting with a tough negotiator today.
Chris:  Good luck!
Jason:  Do you have any tips for me?
Chris:  Aim high.
Jason:  What do you mean by that?
Chris:  If you expect more from the negotiation, you'll get more.
Jason:  That makes sense.
Chris:  If you have low expectations, the outcome may not be satisfying.
Jason:  That's true.
Chris:  Also, be confident!
Doug:  What are you going to do on your business trip?
Lou:  I'm not sure.
Doug:  What's the schedule?

Lou:  I know.  I'm trying to be flexible.

PAMELA: Yeah. I feel much better. I am going back to school on Monday.
MARGARET: That's good! We all missed you.
PAMELA: Thanks. Did I miss a lot of school work?
MARGARET: Yeah. We had homework every night and we have a test next Friday.
PAMELA: Oh no. That makes me worry.
MARGARET: Talk to the teacher. She will understand.

PAMELA: I know. I might get sick again!
MARGARET: I'll see you around 4 pm.
PAMELA: Ok. Thank you!

Bella:  Do you want to eat meatballs tonight?

ALICE: Hi Mary. What's wrong?
MARY: Oh hi Alice. I just got back from the hospital.
ALICE: Is something wrong?
MARY: My son was in an auto accident last night.
ALICE: Oh dear. I'm sorry to hear that. Was he seriously injured?
MARY: Yes. He broke both of his legs and his ribs.
ALICE: That's awful!
MARY: I know. He just got his driver's license a month ago.
ALICE: How scary for him.
MARY: It wasn't his fault though. He was hit by a drunk driver.
ALICE: That's terrible!
MARY: I'm so angry about it! My son could've been killed by an irresponsible driver.
ALICE: You're right! Did they catch the other driver? Was he or she injured?
MARY: Yeah, he was arrested. He wasn't injured.
ALICE: Do you think he will go to jail?
MARY: I don't know. I'm just worried about my son right now.
ALICE: Can I help you with anything?
MARY: Well, I just came home to get a change of clothes. I'm going to go back to the hospital soon. Would you be able to feed our cats tonight?
ALICE: Of course. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.
MARY: Thanks Alice.
Mike:  Did you watch the news this morning?
Susie:  No.  What happened?
Mike:  There was a chemical explosion at my old office.
Susie:  Did anyone get hurt?
Mike:  I don't know yet. 
Susie:  You're lucky you don't work there anymore.

Susie:  Did they evacuate the area?
Mike:  Yeah.  The police and fire department are still there.
Susie:  I should call my friend.  She lives a couple of blocks from there.
PETER: Hey Tom. Are you working late again?
TOM: Yeah, Peter. I have a big project I'm working on.
PETER: How's it going?
TOM: Not well. We keep running into problems with the client.
PETER: What kind of problems.
TOM: The client either doesn't like our designs or keeps changing his mind. It's very frustrating.
PETER: That can be very annoying.
TOM: It is. So, my group has to start over each time. It's such a waste of time and money.
PETER: When is the deadline?
TOM: In two weeks. I don't know how we're going to make it.
PETER: Where's the rest of your group?
TOM: They went to eat. I told them to go. They're going to bring me back some dinner.
PETER: That's good. What are you going to do after your deadline is over?
TOM: Go on a long vacation.
PETER: Good for you!
TOM: Well, I better get back to work. See you in the morning.
CAROL: Hi Anne. What are you doing?
ANNE: Hi Carol. I'm planning a birthday party for Tim.
CAROL: How is that going?
ANNE: Not well. I can't think of anything to do.
CAROL: How many kids do you want to invite?
ANNE: He wants to invite all of the boys in his classroom. That's 12 boys.
CAROL: No girls?
ANNE: He doesn't want to invite any girls.
CAROL: How about an outdoor party?
ANNE: We did that last year and it rained.
CAROL: Oh. That's not fun.
ANNE: I was thinking about taking the kids to a pizza place.
CAROL: Kids like pizza. How about taking them to a movie theater, too?
ANNE: That's too expensive.
CAROL: Yeah. How about renting a movie and watching it at home after the pizza place?
ANNE: I love that idea! Then they can play in our backyard if it doesn't rain.
CAROL: That sounds like a great party.

LUCY: Should I make freshly-squeezed orange juice?
MOM: That would be great. Do you know where the juicer is?
LUCY: Yeah, it's on the top shelf of the pantry.
MOM: Oh no!
LUCY: What's wrong, Mom?

HANNAH: Hopefully, his team will win!

Tim:  I am so hungry.
Dave:  Didn't you eat lunch?

Dave:  What else did you have for lunch?

Hue:  I would prefer a direct flight.  
Nancy:  There is one direct flight leaving tomorrow morning at 7 AM.  It's $100 more expensive.  
Hue:  I'll take it.  
Nancy:  When will you be returning?
Hue:  Don't change the return flight.
Nancy:  Ok.
Walt:  I think we should change the vacation policy.
Whitney:  Why?
Walt:  Other companies have paid vacation.  We do not.
Whitney:  We are a small company. We can't afford paid vacations.
Walt:  Paid vacations would make employees work better.
Whitney:  How?
Walt:  Give employees good benefits and they will work harder.
Whitney:  You have a point, but we cannot afford it.
Walt:  This company is never going to grow if we don't take care of our employees.
Whitney:  I agree, but I don't make the rules.
TOM: Hey Robert! Did you hear what happened in my History class today?
ROBERT: No, what happened, Tom?
TOM: Someone got caught cheating on the test.
ROBERT: Are you serious? Who?
TOM: Peter!
ROBERT: Peter? Didn't he get caught cheating last month, too?
TOM: Yeah!
ROBERT: How did he cheat?
TOM: He wrote some things on his hand and Mrs. Jones saw it.
ROBERT: What did Mrs. Jones do?
TOM: She sent him to the principal's office. I think they called his parents. I saw them walking into the school office.
ROBERT: Wow! He's going to be in big trouble.
TOM: I know! His dad is really strict.
ROBERT: Do you think they are going to suspend him from school?
TOM: I don't know. But if he continues to cheat, Mrs. Jones isn't going to be able to trust him anymore.
ROBERT: Not only Mrs. Jones, but other teachers too.
Jeff:  What was that loud boom?

NANCY: Jennifer, are you going to join the Choir Club?
JENNIFER: No, Nancy. I'm not.
NANCY: Why? You have such a beautiful voice.
JENNIFER: I'm too shy.
NANCY: You sing so well. You could probably get a solo.
JENNIFER: Thanks for the compliment. I'm scared to sing in front of an audience.
NANCY: You're wasting your talent. If I could sing like you, I would join the Choir.
JENNIFER: My mom said the same thing.
NANCY: You should think about it again.
JENNIFER: What if I get on stage and I freeze.
NANCY: Maybe this is great way to overcome your fear.
JENNIFER: I do love singing.
NANCY: Then you should join. You'll make a great addition to the club.
JENNIFER: Ok. Let me think about it.
NANCY: The choir teacher thinks you should join.
JENNIFER: How does she know? She never heard me sing.
NANCY: Yes, she has. I recorded your singing and let her listen to it.
JENNIFER: You did? Did she like it?
NANCY: She loved it! She said you have an amazing voice.
DAD: Greg, I think it's time for you to start helping around the house.
GREG: Ok, Dad.
DAD: Your mom and I want you to start doing some chores.
GREG: Will I get an allowance like Susie?
DAD: Of course you will. First, let's start with cleaning up the playroom when it gets messy.
GREG: Ok. What else?
DAD: How about setting and clearing the dinner table.
GREG: These are easy.
DAD: And, loading and unloading the dishwasher.
GREG: Ok. Do I have to do all of these things every day?
DAD: No. I want you to share these chores with your sister. You can both decide which ones you want to do.
GREG: That's not fair.
DAD: Why isn't this fair?
GREG: She's going to pick the easiest ones for herself and give me the harder chores to do.
DAD: No, she won't.
GREG: You don't know Susie. I think I want a raise in my allowance.
DAD: We haven't told you how much you're getting yet.
GREG: If I have to share chores with my sister, I'm going to be doing most of the work.
ALAN: Mom, are there any more chores to do around the house?
MOM: There are always chores to do. Why?

MOM: Ok. There are a couple of loads of laundry that need to be done.
ALAN: Ok! I can do that.
MOM: They need to be washed, folded, and put away.
ALAN: Got it!
MOM: Let me know if you want more to do after that.
ALAN: Ok. I need a lot more to do.
MOM: I'm curious. What are you saving up for?
ALAN: Do you promise not to say anything?
MOM: I promise.
ALAN: I want to buy Dad a new watch for his birthday.
MOM: That's very sweet of you. He would love it!
ALAN: I only have a couple of weeks to save until his birthday.
MOM: You're a good kid, Alan.
BILLY: Mom, I'm home. Guess where we're going for our field trip this year.
MOM: Oh, hi Billy. Where?
BILLY: We're going to the city aquarium.
MOM: That sounds like a lot of fun. Marine animals are your favorite.
BILLY: I can't wait to go. I'm so excited!
MOM: When is the field trip?
BILLY: Next Wednesday. My teacher needs chaperones for the trip. Can you go, Mom?
MOM: I think so. Let me check my schedule first.
BILLY: I hope you can chaperone.
MOM: Me too. I love going to the aquarium.
BILLY: We need to pack a lunch. We're going to eat at the aquarium.
MOM: Ok. I just looked at my calendar. I'm free that day.
BILLY: That's great, Mom! I'll tell my teacher tomorrow.
MOM: Ok, now it's time to do your homework.
BILLY: I'm so excited. I can't concentrate on studying.
MOM: I understand. But you still need to do your homework.
GARY: Hey Ted. Do you have any boxes you're not using?
TED: I think so. I have to check my garage.
GARY: Great. Thanks.
TED: Are you moving?
GARY: No. I need to clean out my attic today. It's getting full up there.
TED: That's a big chore.
GARY: I know. I don't even remember what's in there anymore.
TED: Well, if you don't know what's in there, you probably don't need it.
GARY: That's what my wife said.
TED: I had to clean out my attic last month and my wife said the same thing to me.
GARY: They must be talking to each other.
TED: What are you going to do with all the stuff?
GARY: I think I'm going to have a garage sale next weekend. What did you do with all of your stuff?
TED: I threw half of it away and donated the other half.
GARY: That's a good idea. Maybe I'll donate the things I don't need.
TED: What about the garage sale?
GARY: That's just going to be another chore to do. I'd rather go golfing.
TED: Good thinking!
Sally:  Has Carol signed the contract?
Joan:  Not yet.  We're still working on it.
Sally:  Why don't we take her out to lunch and discuss things?
Joan:  Good idea.  Maybe she has questions about the contract.
Sally:  Do you know her favorite food or restaurant?
Joan:  I know she loves French food.
Sally:  Find the best French restaurant in the city.

Ron:  Me too.  How do you drink your coffee?
Ashley:  I like to add cream and sugar.
Ron:  I like black coffee.

Ron:  I hope they don't run out of coffee.
Ashley:  I hope they don't run out of donuts.
Ron:  That would be worse.
Gary:  I feel like drinking some coffee.
Amy:  That sounds good.  Where do you want to go?
Gary:  Let's go to Starbucks.
Amy:  I don't want to go to Starbucks.
Gary:  Why not?  They have delicious coffee.
Amy:  That's true, but it is overpriced and I like to support small businesses.
Gary:  Fine.  But next time we are going to Starbucks.
Amy:  Fair enough.
Don:  Do you believe that coffee prevents cancer?
Jane:  I want to believe it.  I love coffee.
Don:  But your coffee is not very healthy.
Jane:  Why do you say that?
Don:  You put lots of cream and sugar in your coffee.
Jane:  It tastes better that way.
Don:  You should drink it black like me.
Jane:  It's too bitter.
Don:  I don't think your coffee will prevent cancer.
Jane:  I'm still going to believe it.

JASON: The company is not making a profit.
JOE: Are you worried?
JASON: Yeah. I'm very worried. I just bought a house.
JOE: I'm really worried too. My wife and I just had a baby. Also, I haven't been at this company for very long. I would be the first one to get laid off.
JASON: This is terrible. What should we do?
JOE: Maybe we should start looking for other jobs.
JASON: But what if it's all a rumor and not true.
JOE: Well, if you heard it from Susan, it must be true.
JASON: Why?
JOE: Her mom is our boss.
Susan:  Do we have a company dress code?
Linda:  Yes.  On Mondays through Thursdays, we have to wear business attire.

Linda:  On Fridays, we can dress casually.
Susan:  What does casual dress mean?

Erin:  This office layout is confusing.
Wendy:  I agree.
Erin:  Our clients have a hard time finding the exit and our offices.
Wendy:  I know.  Bill got lost the other day looking for the restroom.
Erin:  Should we redesign it?
Wendy:  That would be a good idea.
Erin:  I don't think we have the budget for it.
Wendy:  That's too bad.
Erin:  But we should do something soon.
Wendy:  I know.  The layout looks like a maze.
Jane:  We need to turn off the air conditioner.
Tim:  Why?  It's 90 degrees right now.

JANET: Would you like to help me plan it?
KAREN: Sure. Let's make it a potluck, so everyone can bring a dish to share.

KAREN: Right! How many people do you want to invite?
JANET: How about all of the people she works with. How many is that?
KAREN: I think there are about 30 people in our department, including us.
JANET: Should we keep it a secret or let her know?
KAREN: She doesn't like people making a big fuss over her, so let's keep it a secret.
JANET: When should we have the party?
KAREN: When is she moving?
JANET: Next month, I think.
KAREN: Then we should do it soon. She'll be busy packing and getting ready for the move.

Beth:  It might be easier to eat out.

JANE: It is. Do you want to join? Our class is not full.
CAROL: I'm too old to take dance lessons.

CAROL: Really? Free? When are your lessons?
JANE: Every Monday evening at 7 pm.
CAROL: OK. I'll go next Monday. But don't laugh at me. I'm a terrible dancer.

SALLY: Her dad got a job in another state.
MOM: Where is she moving?
SALLY: To California. That's across the country.
MOM: There are many ways you can still keep in touch. You can e-mail, text, and call each other on the phone.
SALLY: But it won't be the same as seeing each other every day. She is my best friend. I'm going to miss her.
MOM: I know you will. When are they moving?
SALLY: At the end of June when the school year ends. In two months.
MOM: Would you like to invite her over this weekend? You can have a sleepover.

SALLY: Yes, we do. Candace and her family.

Sales clerk:  I have a very difficult customer on the phone.

Sales clerk:  The customer wants a full refund on something she purchased over a year ago.

Manager:  I will talk to her.  Transfer the call to me.

Carl:  I'm a single dad.  I need to take my son to school by 8 AM.  Would I be able to start at 9?
Becky:  9 AM is a little late for our company.  This may be a problem.
Carl:  Please consider my situation.  It's hard to be a single dad and have a career.
Becky:  Carl, I completely understand.  I'm a single parent too.  
Carl:  You are?
Becky:  Yes.  So I will discuss it with the other managers and ask them to let you start at 9 AM.
Carl:  Thank you so much!  I look forward to hearing from you.
Colleen:  I'm sick and tired of fixing the dishwasher.

Joel:  Let's go shopping for a new dishwasher today.
Derrick:  We need to have a talk.
Andrew:  Is there a problem?
Derrick:  I feel like I do all of the cleaning.  I clean up your mess too.
Andrew:  I'm sorry.  I promise to keep the apartment clean.
Derrick:  Why don't we divide the housework?
Andrew:  Ok.  How do you want to divide it?
Derrick:  We will clean up our own messes.  Then, we will take turns cleaning the common areas.
Andrew:  What are the common areas?
Derrick:  Places that we use together, like the bathroom, kitchen, and living room.
Andrew:  That sounds fair.
Bill:  Do you remember our 10th birthday?
Mark:  Yes!  We got a puppy that year.
Bill:  I miss that puppy.
Mark:  Me too.  He had a great name.
Bill:  Actually, I don't remember his name.
Mark:  How could you forget his name?  His name was Buster.
Bill:  Oh yeah.  It was a sad day when Buster died.
Mark:  I never wanted another dog after that.
Bill:  How old was Buster when he died?
Mark:  You don't remember anything.  He was 14 years old.
Zach:  I have to negotiate a deal with a client.  
Bill:  How do you think it will go?
Zach:  Not well.  I heard he is very tough.
Bill:  Do you want some advice?
Zach:  Yes!  I'm not good at negotiating.
Bill:  Make sure you do your homework.
Zach:  What do you mean?
Bill:  Collect as much information before negotiation starts, so you know your options.
Zach:  That's great advice.
Bill:  The more info you have, the smarter you will look.
Tracy:  I am so angry!
Helen:  Why?  What happened?
Tracy:  Someone keeps leaving their dog's poop on my lawn.
Helen:  That is so rude.  What are you going to do?
Tracy:  I am going to video record my yard and find out who the person is.
Helen:  Good idea!  Then, you can bag it up and deliver it to their house.
Gary:  Dogs are the best animals in the world.
Sally:  No, they're not.  Cats are the best.
Gary:  Dogs are loyal and obedient.
Sally:  Cats are cute and cuddly.
Gary:  Dogs are cute and cuddly too.   
Sally:  Cats are smart.  They can use a litter box.
Gary:  Dogs are smart too. 
Sally:  Not as smart as cats.
Gary:  I've seen many service dogs, but I've never seen a service cat before.  Have you?
Sally:  Actually, no.
Tiffany:  I'm worried about this meeting.
Sasha:  Why?
Tiffany:  I'm meeting with a really tough negotiator.
Sasha:  Be confident.  You can do it.  
Tiffany:  I'm just worried because our company really needs this contract.
Sasha:  I know we do, but don't let him know how much we need it.
Tiffany:  I won't.  I'll look tough too.
Sasha:  Don't ever let him see you sweat.  That will make him think you're nervous.
Tiffany:  I am nervous!
Sasha:  He doesn't need to know that!
Jon:  I cannot negotiate with this client!
Richard:  What's the problem?
Jon:  He is so rude.  
Richard:  When you negotiate with someone, don't take things personally.
Jon:  I know, but he makes me so angry.
Richard:  Maybe that's his strategy.
HELEN: Do you know how to draw?
SUE: Yes. Drawing is one of my hobbies.
HELEN: Really? I didn't know that.
SUE: I doodle when I'm bored.
HELEN: Can you help my son with his school project?
SUE: Sure. What does he need to do?
HELEN: He needs to draw a picture of a big castle.
SUE: That's not hard at all. When is it due?
HELEN: Tomorrow.
SUE: Oh, that soon?
HELEN: Yeah. He didn't tell me until today.
SUE: Ok, I can come by after dinner.
HELEN: Why don't you come for dinner?
SUE: That would be lovely. Thank you.
HELEN: Thank you! I cannot draw at all and I was so worried about this assignment.
SUE: Don't worry. He will have an awesome castle.
Becky:  I have an emergency.  I spilled coffee on my dress and I need it dry cleaned as soon as possible.
Dry cleaner:  When do you need it?
Becky:  Tonight.  
Dry cleaner:  That is very short notice.  We have a lot of customers this week.
Becky:  It is my wedding anniversary and I would really like to wear this dress.
Dry cleaner:  Wow!  That is a big stain.
Becky:  I am desperate.  I will pay extra.
Dry cleaner:  You have been a good customer for many years.  I will do it for no extra charge.
Becky:  Thank you so much!  I will tell all of my friends about this place.
Dry cleaner:  Thank you, too.  It will be ready by 4 PM.
Mary:  I ordered a paperback book.  It should come in 3-5 days.
Megan:  If you order an e-book, you can get it instantly.
Mary:  I don't like e-books.  
Megan:  Why?
Mary:  I like holding a real book with pages.
Megan:  E-books have pages.
Mary:  They're not real pages.  Paperback books have pages you can turn.
Megan:  E-books can be read in the dark.  
Mary:  That's a good point.  But, I still like paperback books better.
Megan:  You'll never change.
Josie:  I don't like e-books.
Isabel:  Why?  I love them.
Josie:  I love the smell of paper and the feel of a paperback book.
Isabel:  But e-books are so convenient.
Josie:  No, they're not.  What if you run out of batteries?
Isabel:  That's a good point.
JIM: Honey, are you ok?
SUE: Yes, are you ok?
JIM: Yeah. I've never felt an earthquake before?
SUE: Me too. That was scary. We've experience hurricanes, but never an earthquake.
JIM: I'm going to look around and see how bad the damage is.
SUE: Be careful. There could be aftershocks.
JIM: I know. Don't go outside. The power is down. There could be power lines on the ground.
SUE: Ok. Where are the dogs?
JIM: I found them. They're both under the bed.
SUE: They must be scared.
JIM: I wish we could watch the news. I want to know how much damage this earthquake caused.
SUE: Let me find the radio. We can listen to the news.
JIM: I think it's in the garage.
SUE: Do we have any batteries for it?
JIM: Yeah. Let me get them.
SUE: I knew the big one was coming one day, but we weren't prepared.
JIM: Yeah, that was a big mistake.
SUE: We better pack an emergency kit for next time.
Tiffany:  Is that all you are eating?
Joann:  Yeah.  I'm trying to lose weight.
Tiffany:  You need to exercise too.
Joann:  I know.  I've been running two miles every day.
Tiffany:  That's great.  
Joann:  Thanks.  Losing weight is hard.
Michael:  Should we eat in or eat out tonight?
Janet:  Let's eat out.  We haven't eaten out in two months.
Michael:  Ok.  Where should we go?
Janet:  Let's go to our favorite restaurant.
Michael:  The Italian place?
Janet:  No, the Chinese place.
Emily:  Did you see our last electric bill?
Daniel:  No.  Was it high?
Emily:  It was very high.
Daniel:  I think it's the air conditioner.
Emily:  We need to keep it off.
Daniel:  But it's so hot these days.
Bill:  I need to make an emergency trip to our headquarters tonight.
Donna:  There are no direct flights tonight.  There are only non-direct flights.

Donna:  There is one layover in San Francisco for an hour.  
Bill:  That's fine.  Can you book that flight please?
Donna:  Do you need a ride to the airport?
Bill:  No.  I will park my car at the airport.
Andrew:  I'm so busy.
Manny:  Are you done with the report?
Andrew:  No.  I've been in meetings all day.
Manny:  That's why I haven't seen you.
Andrew:  Yeah.  I have another meeting at 4 PM.
Manny:  Why do you have so many meetings?
Andrew:  The managers are discussing annual employee reviews and raises.
Manny:  Is it that time of the year?
Andrew:  Yeah.  The end of the year is always the busiest.
Manny:  You're right.  It's almost 4 PM.  You'd better go.
Mike:  What are you doing after work?
Sue:  I have to take our clients out to dinner.
Mike:  Where are you going to take them?
Sue:  I don't know.  Do you have any suggestions?
Mike:  There's a really good sushi place downtown.
Sue:  The new one on Main Street?
Mike:  Yeah, that's the one.
Sue:  I can't take them there.  
Mike:  Why?
Sue:  Our clients own it.
Sam:  The whole file has been erased.
Aaron:  How did that happen?
Sam:  I don't know.  Who was the last person working on it?
Aaron:  I was the last one to work on it.
Sam:  What did you do to it?
Aaron:  Nothing.  I saved the file and went home.
Sam:  I knew this would happen.
Aaron:  Are you blaming me for this problem?
Sam:  Yes.  You always screw up the projects.
Aaron:  You are so rude.  That's why no one wants to work with you.
Shirley:  Can you do me a favor?
Sasha:  What is it?
Shirley:  Could you take me to the store?
Sasha:  Sure.  Is there something wrong with your car?
Shirley:  Yeah.  It's in the shop for repairs.
Sasha:  Again?  You just got it fixed last month.
Shirley:  I know.  I need a new car.
Sasha:  Do you need a ride anywhere else?
Shirley:  How about the bank?
Sasha:  Ok.  I need to go to the store and the bank too.
Gina:  Khaled, your English is so good now.
Khaled:  I've been going to ESL classes at night.
Gina:  I am very impressed.
Khaled:  Thank you.  I have a question to ask you.  
Gina:  Please ask me.
Khaled:  Would you like to go on a date?
DAD: What are you doing, Charlie?
CHARLIE: My class has to write an essay about where we want to go on our field trip.
DAD: That sounds like an interesting topic.
CHARLIE: My class can't decide where we want to go, so our teacher is going to make it a contest.
DAD: I like that idea. What are the choices?
CHARLIE: Half of my class wants to go to the museum. The other half wants to go to the zoo.
DAD: Where do you want to go?
CHARLIE: I want to go to the zoo because I want to see a lion.
DAD: Didn't you go to the zoo last year?
CHARLIE: Yes, but it was so much fun.
DAD: You may want to try something new this year. The museum is a great place too. You can learn a lot there.
CHARLIE: I know. But I want to see animals.
DAD: Ok. It's your choice. The museum is having a display of old airplanes.
CHARLIE: Airplanes? I really like airplanes too.
DAD: You have a tough decision.
CHARLIE: Now I can't decide. I need to really think about it.
Store Clerk:  May I help you?

Store clerk:  We only have one more in stock.
Customer:  Great!  I will take it.
Store clerk:  Would you like to look at anything else?
Customer:  No, thank you.  I would just like to exchange the sweater, please.
Aaron:  A lot of young people gave me their business cards at the event yesterday.
Rose:  Did you meet any with good potential?
Aaron:  It's hard to say.  I told all of them to send me their resumes.
Rose:  Do you think they will?
Aaron:  I've already received more than half.
Rose:  You should really take time to read through them.  
Aaron:  I know.  I remember when I was young and looking for jobs.  
Rose:  Networking is hard and it can be intimidating.
Aaron:  I fully understand what they're going through.
Rose:  Be generous with your time.  You may find a gem or two. 
Andrew:  Can you help me understand this report?
James:  Sure.  What is the problem?
Andrew:  I don't know what these numbers mean.
James:  It's explained in the report.

Michelle:  We are going to extend our brand of shoes.
Alexa:  What other kinds of shoes are you going to sell?
Michelle:  We'd like to do basketball shoes too.
Alexa:  Your soccer shoes are very popular, so basketball shoes should be a hit too.

Alexa:  I would love to.  Let's set up a meeting to discuss the details.
Michelle:  Great!  I will email my team and get back to you as soon as possible.
ALAN: Hi Greg. What are you working on?
GREG: Hi Alan. I'm doing some extra credit to improve my grade in History class.
ALAN: What grade are you getting right now?
GREG: C.
ALAN: That's not too bad.
GREG: It's an average grade. I want to get a better grade.

ALAN: That should be enough information.
GREG: I have so much to read and write. I hope I have enough time.
ALAN: Well, I guess it's not supposed to be easy since it's extra credit.
GREG: Yeah, you're right. I better stop talking and start reading.
Don:  I'm failing my English class.
Eric:  Why?
Don:  I don't understand what is going on.
Eric:  Did you talk to your teacher about it?
Don:  She's the problem.
Eric:  What's the problem?
Don:  She speaks too fast.  I don't understand what she's saying.
Kathy:  I can't believe you're on social media again.
Jody:  I'm reading the news.
Kathy:  These people are your friends.  They're not reporters.
Jody:  They post what's going on in the news.
Kathy:  That's not real news.
Jody:  It's more fun than the news channels.  Real news is boring.
STAN: What happened, Mark?
MARK: A tree fell during the windstorm and hit my house.
STAN: Wow! Is everyone ok?
MARK: Yes. Luckily, we weren't home at the time.
STAN: Yes, you are very lucky!
MARK: I know. It was the big tree in our yard.
STAN: I can't believe it. Will insurance cover the repair costs?
MARK: I hope so. I'm waiting for the insurance guy to come right now.
STAN: What are you going to do? DO you have a place to stay while your house gets fixed?
MARK: Yeah, we're going to stay at my parents' house. They don't live far from here.
STAN: That's good!
MARK: I really liked that tree. It was so big and beautiful. And, now it's in my living room.
STAN: You're a strong man if you can joke about it.
MARK: Well, if I don't laugh, I'll cry.
STAN: I would be crying right now.
MARK: Believe me, Stan. I am crying on the inside.

SUSAN: That's perfect weather for camping.
HENRY: We can go fishing too.
SUSAN: The kids are going to love it.
HENRY: Let's not tell them yet.
SUSAN: Why?

SUSAN: That would be fun too.
HENRY: Let me try to make a reservation for camping first.
SUSAN: Ok. Here's the number.

ROBERT: I remember it was at Uncle Walter's house last year. That was fun.
MOM: Do you need any help?
ROBERT: Yes. Could you please go to the store and buy some ice?

ROBERT: I can't wait to see all of my cousins.
MOM: They're excited to see you too. But right now, please go buy some ice.

DAVID: I know where it is. I've been there before. It's a fun place.
JOE: This will be my first trip. I'm excited.
DAVID: There are a lot of fun roller coasters to ride on.

DAVID: That's too bad. But why are you taking your school books home?
JOE: I'm going to miss one week of school, so I need to do homework while I'm there.
DAVID: You're going to do homework on vacation?
JOE: Yeah. I don't want to be behind in class.
DAVID: You're a good student.
JOE: Well, my parents are making me bring my books.
DAVID: I would be against it.
JOE: Then I won't be going to Disneyland.
Micky:  Our deadline is Monday.
Ted:  We still have much more work to do.
Micky:  Let's divide the work this weekend.
Ted:  Great idea.  I'll take half of it home.
Micky:  Ok.  I'll take the other half home.
Ted:  We can email each other what we finish and review it together.

Ted:  Do you think we'll finish by Monday? 
Micky:  I think if we divide the work, we will finish by Monday.

Heather:  Abby, do you have a lot of clients today?
Abby:  No, I'm pretty open all day.
Heather:  Could you fill in for me today?
Abby:  Sure.  Is something wrong?
Heather:  I'm not feeling that well.
Abby:  You should go home.  
Heather:  Thanks.  Your first haircut client is Carol at 10 AM.
Derek:  I think the company is in trouble.
Sean:  What kind of trouble?
Derek:  Financial trouble.
Sean:  What makes you think that?
Derek:  I overheard Lou talking about bankruptcy laws.
Sean:  We can't lose our jobs.  I just bought a home.
SARAH: Hello?
KATHY: Hi Sarah. This is Kathy. I have a huge favor to ask.
SARAH: What is it?
KATHY: Are you free tonight? I need a babysitter to watch Michael.
SARAH: I'm so sorry. I'm not available. We have tickets to the play tonight.
KATHY: We do too. Our regular babysitter is sick and the tickets are non-refundable.
SARAH: Jenny is home from college this weekend. Would you like me to ask her if she is available?
KATHY: That would be wonderful!
SARAH: I'll ask her when she gets home. She went to the store. She should be back in a few minutes.
KATHY: Thank you! We will pay her, of course. I know she is great with kids. I remember her playing with Michael before. He really liked her.
SARAH: Yeah, she loves children. She is studying to become a teacher.
KATHY: That's great! She will be a good teacher.
SARAH: If Michael has homework, she can help him with it.
KATHY: Great idea! But I'm not sure Michael will like this idea.
SARAH: That's true. He may not like Jenny after tonight.
JOE: Hey Stan. Do you know any good mechanics around here?
STAN: Yeah. I use a really good one. What's wrong with your car?
JOE: I'm not sure. I think there is a problem with my transmission.
STAN: Transmission problems can be very expensive.
JOE: I know. I took it to an auto shop yesterday and it was so expensive. I'm looking for someone cheaper, but who can also do a good job.
STAN: You should go to my mechanic. You can trust him and his repair costs are pretty reasonable.
JOE: Is he close to us?
STAN: Yeah. His shop is just a few blocks away.
JOE: That's good. I hope I don't have to replace the transmission. That will be really expensive.
STAN: I know. I had to replace the transmission on my old car. The repair cost more than the price of the car.
JOE: That's crazy! If my repair costs too much, I'm just going to buy a new car.
STAN: Can you afford a new car?
JOE: No. I would have to buy a used car.
STAN: Let me get my mechanic's phone number. You can decide what you want to do after he takes a look at your car.
JOE: Thanks.
STAN: I can give you a ride home if you need to leave your car there.
JOE: If it's only a few blocks away, I'll walk. If my car is too expensive to fix, I better get used to walking.

Ryan:  Good.  I'm getting to know a lot of people in the office.

Erin:  Our office goes out to lunch together every Tuesday.  You should join us.
Ryan:  Ok.  Jane mentioned that too.
Erin:  Good.  Well, let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Ryan:  Thanks!  
SANDY: Hi Janice. Why do you look so nervous?
JANICE: Oh, hi Sandy. Bill and I are going out to dinner without the kids.
SANDY: That sounds fun! So, why do you look nervous?
JANICE: We hired a babysitter. This will be our first time leaving the kids with a babysitter.
SANDY: Really? Who did you hire?
JANICE: Our friend's daughter, Natalie. She is 18 years old.
SANDY: Natalie? Carol's daughter?
JANICE: Yes. Do you know her?
SANDY: Yeah. She used to babysit my children a couple of years ago.
JANICE: Did you like her as a babysitter?
SANDY: Yes. She was a very responsible girl.
JANICE: That's great to hear.
SANDY: You can trust her. She babysits for a few people I know.
JANICE: Yeah, I heard she has a lot of babysitting experience.
SANDY: She loves children. She wants to go to medical school and become a pediatric doctor.
JANICE: Wow! She must be a smart girl.
SANDY: She is. She was a straight A student in high school and she has been accepted to many colleges.
JANICE: That's awesome!
SANDY: She's babysitting a lot to save money for college tuition.
JANICE: Now I feel a lot better about hiring her as a babysitter.
JAMES: Hey Phil, I'm so glad it's Friday.
PHIL: I agree, James. It was a stressful work week.
JAMES: Have any fun plans this weekend?
PHIL: Yeah, I'm going fishing with my buddies.
JAMES: Lucky!
PHIL: Do you want to join us?
JAMES: I can't. I'm helping my brother move. He recently bought a house.
PHIL: That's too bad. We're going to have beautiful weather too.
JAMES: I'm glad we're going to have good weather. I don't want to move boxes and furniture in the rain.
PHIL: That's true. When are you going to be done?
JAMES: I don't know. He has a lot of stuff. It could be all day.
PHIL: Well, if you get done early, why don't you meet us at the lake?
JAMES: Are you going out on a boat?
PHIL: No, we're going to fish on the lake shore. None of us have a boat.
JAMES: My brother has a boat. I can ask him if we can borrow it sometime.
PHIL: That would be awesome! Thanks!
JAMES: Well, I'm going to head home now. I'm tired.
PHIL: Yeah. Me too. Call me this weekend if you get done early.
TIMOTHY: Dad, what are we doing this weekend?
DAD: I have a surprise for you, Timothy.
TIMOTHY: What is it?
DAD: Here. Open it.
TIMOTHY: I think I know what it is?
DAD: Can you tell by the shape?
TIMOTHY: Yeah. Is it a fishing pole?
DAD: Well, open it up and find out.
TIMOTHY: It is! I love it. I've never gone fishing before.
DAD: Your grandfather and I used to go fishing when I was a child. Now, I can take you.
TIMOTHY: I can't wait!
DAD: You also need a life jacket.
TIMOTHY: Why?
DAD: You should always wear a life jacket if you're going in a boat.
TIMOTHY: Ok, dad.
DAD: Now let's go to the fishing store and buy some bait.
TIMOTHY: What's bait?
DAD: Things that will attract the fish to the hook.
TIMOTHY: Like worms?
DAD: Exactly!
TIMOTHY: This is going to be so much fun!
JOHN: Hey Sam. You're home? Where's your car?
SAM: Oh hey John. It's in the auto shop.
JOHN: Again? What's wrong with it this time?
SAM: I'm not sure. It's making a lot of strange noises.
JOHN: That's weird. It's not even an old car.
SAM: I know. I've only had it for three years. My mechanic doesn't know what the problem is.
JOHN: He doesn't know? What is he doing then?
SAM: Trying all different things. I'm getting tired of waiting for him to fix it.
JOHN: You should take it to another mechanic.
SAM: I should, but I already paid him. He just keeps saying he will fix it.
JOHN: He doesn't sound very trustworthy.
SAM: I know. I should've gone somewhere else. But he was so cheap. He was the cheapest I could find.
JOHN: Maybe too cheap isn't always better.
SAM: I'm learning that now.
JOHN: You should demand a refund.
SAM: I wish I could, but it's a little complicated.
JOHN: Why is it complicated?
SAM: The mechanic is my brother-in-law.
Stan:  I really like my work schedule.
Bill:  Do you work flexible hours?

Rob:  Do you need help?
Lisa:  Yeah.  Can you grab some of these calls?
Rob:  Sure.  Who should I speak with?
Lisa:  You pick.
Rob:  I'll take Technical Support.  You can have the angry customers.
SUE: Hello?
LINDA: Hi Sue. This is Linda. I have a question about the flu shot.
SUE: What is it?
LINDA: Are your kids getting the flu shot this year?
SUE: They already did.
LINDA: They did?
SUE: Yeah. We went to the doctor's office last week. They both got them.
LINDA: What about you?
SUE: I got one too. So did Jeff.
LINDA: Really? Bill won't get one.
SUE: Why?
LINDA: He says he never gets sick.
SUE: Well, that could be true. But we don't want to risk it this year.
LINDA: I completely understand that.
SUE: Both of my kids got really sick last year. I just want to give them extra protection just in case.
LINDA: Yeah. I think I'm going to make an appointment for all of us.
SUE: Even Bill?
LINDA: No. He won't go. He'll just cancel his appointment.
SUE: Well, at least the three of you will be protected.
LINDA: That's true. Ok, I better call the doctor's office now.
Samantha:  Do you follow the news?
Nicole:  Not really.  It's boring.
Samantha:  How can you say it's boring?
Nicole:  It's always the same stuff:  violence and politics.
Samantha:  I have to watch, read, or listen to the news every day.
Nicole:  Then you can tell me what's going on since I don't watch, read or listen to the news.
Dan:  Hi, Phil.  This is Dan Connelly.  We met at the company golf tournament last week.

Phil:  Great!  I look forward to receiving it.  
MARY: I just spoke with my mom. She and my dad are devastated. The fire is moving closer to their home.
BOB: What can they do?
MARY: The firefighters say there is nothing they can do at this point. They have to evacuate immediately.
BOB: That's horrible.
MARY: I know. I wish I could help them, but we live in another state.
BOB: Where are they going to stay tonight?
MARY: They're going to stay with my sister until they find another place to live.
BOB: Why don't they stay with us, too? They can come here after things settle down.
MARY: That might be a good idea. Maybe being away from there will help them forget about all of this.
BOB: Well, they will never forget. But hopefully, they will be able to move on.
MARY: Bob, I'm so sad. That was my childhood home. I have so many memories of that place.
BOB: I'm sorry. I know this must be very difficult for you and your parents.
MARY: Thanks. My sister too. She and I grew up in that house. My parents lived there for forty years.
BOB: I can't believe a wildfire can destroy everything so quickly. It's just terrible.
MARY: They're going to lose everything. The firefighters gave them only a few hours to pack.
BOB: Is anyone helping them pack?
MARY: Yeah, my sister is with them. She's going to call me later tonight.

BILL: Yes, but it is very limited.
JEFF: What time do you get there?
BILL: We usually go around 4 pm. The fireworks show starts around 6 pm.
JEFF: Do you take your dog?
BILL: No. He doesn't like loud noises. It scares him. A couple of years ago, he ran away during the fireworks show.
JEFF: That's terrible. Poor dog.
BILL: So, now we leave him with my parents on the fourth of July. Their neighborhood is very quiet.
JEFF: Your parents don't like fireworks?
BILL: Not anymore. They say it's too loud. Their neighborhood does not allow fireworks.
JEFF: Why?
BILL: They say it's too loud and dangerous.
JEFF: Oh, I understand. That's why I watch the fireworks on TV.
BILL: That's a quiet and safe place to watch them.

SUSAN: That's scary. Do you know what caused the accident?
PETER: I don't know. I didn't see it happen.
SUSAN: You should've called me. We were supposed to meet Cathy and Rick for dinner at 6 pm.
PETER: After seeing the accident, I didn't want to use my phone while driving.

PETER: We should just eat at home tonight. I think traffic is going to be bad.
SUSAN: Oh no!
PETER: What's wrong?
SUSAN: I just got a text from Cathy. She said she and Rick were in an accident on the freeway! They're at the hospital.
PETER: Oh my goodness. Let's go to the hospital now.

BETH: She likes clothes and makeup.
JENNIFER: What did you buy her?
BETH: I got her a red scarf.
JENNIFER: I don't have time to go shopping.

BETH: It was yesterday.
JENNIFER: I'm sorry! I forgot yours too. I'm a bad friend.
BETH: No, you're just a busy friend.

TOM: You don't believe it?
SALLY: No, absolutely not.
TOM: Do you believe in werewolves?
SALLY: What are werewolves?
TOM: Creatures that are half human, half wolf. They come out when there's a full moon.
SALLY: Now you are being ridiculous. I'm going to look for the brightest star.
TOM: Why?
SALLY: If you see the brightest star, you can make a wish and it will come true.
TOM: Now you're being ridiculous.
SALLY: I'm going to wish that we stop this conversation.

MOM: Sure. What do you need to buy?
KAREN: Something for my new apartment.
MOM: How do you like your first apartment? Do you like living alone?
KAREN: Yes, it's great. But my apartment is so empty. I need some furniture to make it feel cozy.
MOM: What do you need?
KAREN: I already have a bed and a sofa that you and Dad gave me. I need to buy a dining table and chairs.
MOM: Where do you sit to eat?
KAREN: Right now, I eat on the sofa. But I'd like to invite people over for dinner and be able to dine comfortably.
MOM: Can you afford to buy a new dining table and chairs?
KAREN: I have some money saved, but not a lot.
MOM: Why don't we try a yard sale? I always see people selling their dining room furniture at yard sales.
KAREN: That's a great idea! Maybe if the furniture looks really old, I can get a good deal. I can just paint them.
MOM: Right! We should go today.
KAREN: Yes! I'm excited to see what I can find.
MOM: Maybe I'll find something too.

Martha:  Why didn't you return it to the store?
Mia:  The store wouldn't take it back.  It was too late.
MIKE: Hey Ben, have you seen the price of gas lately?
BEN: Yeah Mike. It's really high. That's why I've been riding the bus to work.
MIKE: I wish I could ride the bus, but I would have to take three buses to get to work.
BEN: Three?
MIKE: Yeah. It would take me twice as long to get to work.
BEN: That's not good. I only have to take one bus and it takes me directly from my home to my office building.
MIKE: You're lucky!
BEN: I know. What about riding your bike to work?
MIKE: No, I'm not very good at cycling and it's too far.
BEN: You can carpool with someone.
MIKE: That's a good idea. Then we could share the cost of gas and ride in the carpool lane.
BEN: Do you work with anyone who lives near you?
MIKE: Yeah, my boss.
BEN: Would you want to ride with your boss?
MIKE: No, not really. I think I'd rather pay more for gas.

CAROL: What made you decide to get one now?
RUTH: My car broke down in the middle of the road last night and I had to walk to the nearest pay phone to call a friend. It was scary walking alone at night.
CAROL: Yeah, cell phones are very convenient. Do you know what kind you want to get?
RUTH: Just a basic one. I don't need anything fancy.
CAROL: Do you want a smartphone?
RUTH: What is that?
CAROL: You don't know what a smartphone is?
RUTH: No. Can you explain it to me?
CAROL: A smartphone is a cell phone that also has computer features. You have e-mail and Internet access.
RUTH: I don't need those things. I don't even have an e-mail address.
CAROL: You don't have an e-mail address?
RUTH: No.
CAROL: Then how do you send written communication to other people?
RUTH: I write and mail letters.
CAROL: Wow! That's amazing! People don't mail letters anymore.
RUTH: But I think I will get a cell phone, just in case of an emergency.
CAROL: That's a good idea! Welcome to modern technology, Ruth!

JANET: Hi Alice. Do you know anyone who wants a dog?
ALICE: What kind of dog? Yours?
JANET: Yeah. We have to give our dog away.
ALICE: Why? You love Buster.
JANET: I know. But we just discovered that our son is allergic to dogs.
ALICE: Really?
JANET: Yeah, he sneezes and gets a rash every time he pets him.
ALICE: That's terrible.
JANET: When Steven was a baby, we didn't know he was allergic. But now he's crawling around and playing with Buster. His symptoms get really bad.
ALICE: I'm so sorry to hear that. You and Charlie have had Buster since he was a puppy. I remember when all three of you moved in next door.
JANET: I know. We got Buster before our son was born. Charlie is so sad.
ALICE: How about your relatives? Are there any family members that could take Buster? Then you can still see him whenever you want.
JANET: I asked my sister and Charlie asked his brothers. But no one is able to take a dog right now.
ALICE: Well, our kids are all grown up and living on their own. Stan and I get lonely sometimes. Would you like us to adopt Buster?
JANET: Really? You would do that?
ALICE: Stan and I really like Buster. He's housetrained and well-behaved. He rarely barks too.
JANET: Don't you need to talk to Stan first!
ALICE: Oh, he'll say yes. He's been talking about getting a dog lately. He'll be happy it's Buster.

JOAN: I'd love to see her perform some day. Let me know when she will be on stage again.
CAROL: Ok. I will. I'm so excited and proud of her.
JOAN: Is she nervous?
CAROL: Yes, she is very nervous. But she loves acting, so this will be a true test for her.
JOAN: Is this part of her school assignment?
CAROL: No. This is something she auditioned for on her own.
JOAN: She won the lead part?
CAROL: Yeah. She was shocked. Her drama professor is coming too.
JOAN: How does she feel about that?
CAROL: She's more nervous about her drama professor than the rest of the audience.
JOAN: But she is not going to be graded on it.
CAROL: Yeah, but she wants to do well in front of him.
JOAN: I understand. Well, have a lovely time tonight!
GREG: I'm going to an art gallery tonight.
CATHY: That's cool.
GREG: My friend, Jane, is an artist. She's displaying her work there.
CATHY: I love art. I paint in my spare time.
GREG: Really? I didn't know that. My friend is a sculptor.
CATHY: Sculpting? That's fascinating.
GREG: Would you like to come with me tonight?
CATHY: I can't. I already have plans.
GREG: She is going to be displaying her work all week. Would you like to go tomorrow night?
CATHY: Sure. I would love to.
GREG: I can introduce you to her. She always loves talking to people about art.
CATHY: I don't know that much about it. I just really enjoy looking at it.
GREG: I don't know a lot about art either. I'm just going to support her tonight.
CATHY: You're a good friend. What is your interest?
GREG: I prefer music.
CATHY: I love music too. But painting is my passion.
GREG: I would like to see your work one day.
CATHY: I can show you some right now. I have them on my wall.
GREG: Let's go see them.
Joe:  I have a meeting with the boss today.

Sue:  Good luck!
NANCY: Hi Sheila. Have you been to the new amusement park yet?
SHEILA: No. When did it open?
NANCY: Last weekend.
SHEILA: Was it crowded?
NANCY: It was very crowded. Parking is terrible too.
SHEILA: Did you have fun?
NANCY: Oh yes! The roller coasters are really fun. My kids had a great time. It was even fun for the adults too.
SHEILA: I didn't know it was open yet. I will have to take my son soon.
NANCY: You should. They will love it.
SHEILA: Are the tickets expensive?
NANCY: Yeah, they're pretty expensive. But your family will enjoy it.
SHEILA: Maybe we'll go this weekend. We don't have any plans on Saturday. My son has been asking about it.
NANCY: If you go on Saturday, try to go early. There aren't enough parking spots. They need to add more.
SHEILA: Ok. That's good to know. Do you have any other tips?
NANCY: The lines for the rides are very long, so be patient.
SHEILA: Ok. I assumed that. Now I have to convince my husband to go.
NANCY: He doesn't like amusement parks?
SHEILA: No. I have motion sickness, so I can't ride any of the roller coasters. That means my husband has to ride all of them with our son.
NANCY: Tell him to be prepared. There are a lot of roller coasters.
SALLY: Carl. Are you going to watch television all day?
CARL: No. Is there something you want to do?
SALLY: It's a beautiful day. The sun is shining. We should do something outdoors.
CARL: Ok. What should we do?
SALLY: Let's go to the beach.
CARL: OK. I'll grab the beach chairs and towels.
SALLY: Great! I'll pack some snacks and drinks. Don't forget the sunscreen.
CARL: Where is it?
SALLY: It's in the bathroom cabinet.
CARL: Is there anything else we need to bring?
SALLY: I'll bring the camera. I want to take pictures of the sunset.
CARL: Good idea! The sunset is beautiful at the beach.
SALLY: Do you remember the last time we went to the beach?
CARL: No. It's been a long time. Why don't we go more often?
SALLY: Because you're always watching TV.
CARL: Ok. Let's go to the beach when the weather is nice and watch TV when it rains.
SALLY: That's a deal!
CATHY: Dad, what are we doing today?
DAD: Cathy, it's a surprise.
CATHY: Is it a special occasion?
DAD: No. Just a short family trip.
CATHY: Does Mom know?
DAD: Of course. It was her idea.
CATHY: Where is Mom?
DAD: She is at the store getting things for our trip.
CATHY: I'm so curious. Can you please tell me?
DAD: No. You have to be patient.
CATHY: Ok. Can I help you with anything?
DAD: Sure. Why don't you pack your swimsuit and life jacket?
CATHY: I know what we're doing!
DAD: You do?
CATHY: Yes. We're going to the lake!
DAD: How did you know?
CATHY: You asked me to pack a swimsuit and a life jacket. Also, you are pulling out the canoe from the garage.
DAD: It looks like I can't keep a secret.
JANE: Hey Carol, are you done with your final exams?
CAROL: Yes, Jane! I had my last one this morning. How about you?
JANE: Yeah, I got done an hour ago.
CAROL: Do you want to celebrate?
JANE: Sure! What should we do?
CAROL: I don't know. Should we throw a party?
JANE: What if our friends are not done with exams.
CAROL: Yeah, you're right. Do you want to go dancing?
JANE: I don't know how to dance.
CAROL: You don't? It's easy. Just move your body to music.
JANE: I look silly when I dance.
CAROL: Me too. I don't care.
JANE: Let's do something else.
CAROL: Ok. Do you have any ideas?
JANE: Do you want to go see a play?
CAROL: That sounds boring. I want to do something active.
JANE: I think we have different ideas of fun.
CAROL: Yeah. How about shopping? Do you want to go to the mall?
JANE: I love shopping. Let's do that. We can eat dinner there too.
CAROL: Great! Let's meet at the department store at 4 pm.
GREG: Hey Steve. My family and I want to do something fun this weekend? Do you have any suggestions?
STEVE: The weather is going to be nice. You should do something outdoors.
GREG: Yeah, it's supposed to be sunny all weekend.
STEVE: How about a picnic at the park?
GREG: We do that often. I want to do something more fun.
STEVE: How about the city zoo? I heard that bear cubs were recently born there.
GREG: That's a good idea. We haven't been to the zoo in a long time.
STEVE: Then you should definitely go this weekend.
GREG: The last time we were there, it started raining. None of the animals wanted to come out.
STEVE: That must've been boring.
GREG: It was boring. The kids wanted to go home early.
STEVE: The animals should be more visible since the weather is going to be sunny this weekend.
GREG: Yeah. I think we will go to the zoo. Hopefully, this time it'll be more fun.
STEVE: Actually, I have four tickets to the zoo. You can have them. Our family won't be able to go. The tickets expire this weekend.
GREG: Thanks, Steve! Let me pay you for them. Zoo tickets are expensive.
STEVE: Don't worry about it. It's my gift to you since your last visit was not fun.
GREG: Are you sure! This is very generous of you.
STEVE: Also, you mowed my lawn a few times after I had back surgery last year. I really appreciated that.
GREG: I'm glad we're neighbors.
Bob:  Our client has invited us to play at his private golf course.
Jeff:  That should be fun.
Bob:  Can you join us this Saturday?
Jeff:  No.  I'm busy this weekend.
Bob:  I heard that our client does not like to lose.
Jeff:  Then maybe I should join you.  I'm terrible at golf.
Jessica:  Did you hear about Molly and Dan?
Diane:  No, what's going on?
Jessica:  They're getting a divorce.
Diane:  Really?  They've been married for 30 years.
Jessica:  Dan cheated on Molly.
Diane:  That is awful!
JOAN: Why do you look so happy, Carol?

CAROL: I know. But I love looking at baby clothes. Do you want to go with me?
JOAN: Sure. Maybe I'll get something for my grandkids too. Let me grab my purse.
ANGIE: Hey Janet, should we do something special for Grandma and Grandpa's anniversary?
JANET: Sure. How long have they been married?

JANET: 50 years! That's a really long time.
ANGIE: I know. They got married in their early twenties.
JANET: That's amazing! We should definitely do something special.
ANGIE: Why don't we throw them a surprise party? We can invite all of our relatives.
JANET: That's a great idea.
ANGIE: Let's make a slideshow of their life together.
JANET: Perfect! That's going to be so beautiful.
ANGIE: I'm sure Mom has a lot of pictures we can go through.
JANET: Let's meet at Mom's tonight and plan the whole party.
ANGIE: Yeah, we'll need her help.
JANET: We can show pictures of their wedding, their children, and grandchildren.
ANGIE: Too bad we aren't doing this next year.
JANET: Why?

JANET: What? You're pregnant?
ANGIE: Yeah!
JANET: There's going to be another big celebration next year!

Stan:  I hope he meets your expectations.
BARBARA: Hi Alice. How did you like the hotel?
ALICE: It was lovely, Barbara. The rooms were spacious and clean.
BARBARA: Did you get a good deal on it?
ALICE: Yeah. They had an online special. If you reserved a room three weeks early, you got 20% off the regular room rate.
BARBARA: That's a good deal.
ALICE: The swimming pool and spa were really nice too. The swimming pool was warm. There was also a sauna.
BARBARA: Oh, that's very nice. Joe loves saunas. I need to tell him about this place.
ALICE: The parking is free and so is the Wi-Fi.
BARBARA: That's good to know.
ALICE: There's a shuttle bus that takes you to the downtown area where all of the shops and restaurants are. It was very convenient.
BARBARA: Anything else?
ALICE: The concierge was very helpful and the front desk clerks were very nice.
BARBARA: Sounds like it was a wonderful place to stay.
ALICE: It was. I would recommend this place to everyone.
BARBARA: Is there a restaurant in the hotel?

ALICE: I can't wait to go back.

DAN: Ok. Who?

DAN: Ok. But Linda is a vegetarian.
TIM: What is a vegetarian?
DAN: A vegetarian is a person who does not eat meat.
TIM: Oh. Maybe we should invite someone else.
DAN: How about Susie?
TIM: Ok. Let's invite Sandy and Susie.
DAN: I will go to the market and buy four steaks. What else should we eat?
TIM: How about potatoes and salad.
DAN: Ok. I will go to the market now. Can you call Sandy and Susie?
TIM: Sure. Dan, why aren't you leaving? What's wrong?

DAN: Ok. I'll be back soon. I hope the weather gets better.
TIM: I hope so too.
JOAN: Hi Carol. I have some new tomatoes and cucumbers from my garden. Would you like some?
CAROL: I would love some, Joan. The tomatoes you gave me last time were delicious.
JOAN: I know. I made spaghetti sauce with them. I'm growing more vegetables this year.
CAROL: What are you growing?
JOAN: Zucchinis and lettuce.
CAROL: That's amazing! You won't have to buy any more vegetables at the market.
JOAN: I know. I'll let you know when the zucchinis and lettuce are ready.
CAROL: Thank you. You're so generous.
JOAN: Well, you always make me apple pies with apples from your apple tree.
CAROL: I will make you more in exchange for the vegetables.
JOAN: That's a deal!
CAROL: Have you thought about selling your vegetables at the local farmer's market?
JOAN: No. I like giving them to my family and friends.
CAROL: That's nice of you.
JOAN: I live alone, so I can't eat all of the vegetables by myself.

Cameron:  I think you're right.
CATHY: Hi Joan. What is Amanda going to be for Halloween?
JOAN: Hi Cathy. She wants to be a ballerina. What about Sally?
CATHY: She can't decide between a bear and a lion.
JOAN: That's cute. Are you going to make her costume?
CATHY: No, not this year. It's too much work. How about you?
JOAN: I'm lucky. Amanda took ballet lessons last month, so she can wear her ballet outfit.
CATHY: That's smart.
JOAN: Yeah. Costumes can be so expensive.
CATHY: I know. That's why I made Sally's costume last year.
JOAN: What was she last year? I can't remember.
CATHY: A butterfly.
JOAN: That's right. She was so cute.
CATHY: Thanks. This year, she wants to be an animal.
JOAN: That's not a bad idea. It's going to be cold outside. Her costume will keep her warm.

JOAN: Or you may have to make her costume again.

MARK: That's great! I've never been to Hawaii.
JASON: It's beautiful there! The beaches are sandy and the weather is nice.

JOE: Didn't you hear? The weather report is predicting heavy rain and severe flooding in our area.
TIM: No, I didn't hear that. I haven't watched the news in a few days.
JOE: I'm heading to the store to buy sandbags.
TIM: Sandbags? Why?
JOE: To stop the water from entering my house. You should do the same thing.
TIM: I think I'll just evacuate if that happens.
JOE: I can't do that. I need to stay here with all of my animals.
TIM: You don't have any place to take them?
JOE: No. I need to make sure they are safe.
TIM: Do you need help loading the sandbags into your truck?
JOE: That would be great. Aren't you worried at all?
TIM: I guess I should be. But every time the weather person says something terrible is going to happen, it never does.
JOE: Well, I'm not risking it this time.
TIM: Now you have me worried.
JOE: You should be.
Bob:  Can you help me move some furniture?

JOE: I can't believe all of that happened in one year.
TOM: That's why I'm hoping the New Year will be much better.
JOE: I'm sure it will be.
TOM: Yeah. I have a job interview next week. My parents loaned me money to buy a new car. My cat is on medication. The vet thinks he will make a full recovery.

JOE: Sure! We can toast to a Happy New Year.

Joann:  Wow!  That's going to be a lot of fun!

Mark:  What happened?
Helen:  We are going through the largest recall in the company's history.
Mark:  What is the recall?
Helen:  Airbags.  They can explode without warning.
Mark:  That is extremely dangerous.

Mark:  I don't think the company can survive.
Helen:  I know.  We have a very bad reputation now.
Mark:  I think you should look for another job.
Martha:  I should have studied harder in college.
Joan:  It's not too late.
Martha:  I can't go back to school at this age.
Joan:  Why not?  Lots of people go back to school.

Chris:  Why?  Can you afford to quit?

Lou:  I guess we will all have to wait too.
SALLY: Why are you so dressed up, Jane?
JANE: Oh, hi Sally. I have a job interview today.
SALLY: That's great. Where?
JANE: At the bank. I'm applying for a teller position.
SALLY: But why do you look so nervous?
JANE: Because I don't have much work experience, but I'm a hard worker and good with numbers.
SALLY: Tell them that.
JANE: I'm going to. I just hope I don't mess up.
SALLY: Don't worry so much. You're smart and you get along well with everyone.

SALLY: Just answer them the best you can. Be confident.
JANE: Ok. I just need to relax.
SALLY: What time is your interview?
JANE: In an hour. I better leave soon. I don't want to be late.
SALLY: Yeah, don't be late. That would be a bad first impression.
JANE: You're right. Thanks for your advice and encouragement. I feel much better.
SALLY: Good. Now go!

SEAN: Hey, how's the job search going, Rick?
RICK: Not well, Sean. I've sent out over 30 resumes and no one has called me.
SEAN: I think a lot of people are looking for jobs right now. The economy isn't very good, so companies aren't hiring people.
RICK: That's what it seems like. But I need a job.
SEAN: How long have you been out of work?
RICK: 3 months.
SEAN: What kind of work do you do?
RICK: I'm an electrician.
SEAN: Have you thought about opening your own business?

SEAN: I understand. If I hear anyone looking for an electrician, I'll let you know.
RICK: Thanks. It's been frustrating.
SEAN: Why did you leave your last job?
RICK: I didn't get along with my boss.

Devin:  That's a good idea.
MARK: Hey Billy. Do you want to come over after school?
BILLY: Hey Mark. No. I have to finish my chores. I didn't do them all week, so now I have to do them all today.
MARK: What do you have to do?
BILLY: Rake the yard and clean my room.
MARK: Is that going to take a long time?
BILLY: Have you seen my room? It looks like a tornado went through it.
MARK: Why didn't you clean it before?
BILLY: I hate cleaning. Do you have chores?
MARK: Yeah, but I try to finish them as soon as possible.
BILLY: You're smart! Now, I have to spend Friday afternoon doing chores.

BILLY: Do you want to help me with my chores?
MARK: No way! I'm going to enjoy my Friday afternoon.
BILLY: Well, I better get to work or I'll be doing it after dinner too.

BILLY: I know. I say that every week.

Sharon:  What are the cookies for?
Martha:  I'm trying to be a nice neighbor.
Sharon:  Maybe that will work.
CATHY: Mom, why do people get Labor Day off?
MOM: Well, Cathy. It's the day we honor working Americans.
CATHY: So, we celebrate people that work?
MOM: Yes. Back in the late 1800's, many Americans were working long hours under poor conditions.  People protested to have better working conditions and a special holiday was created for workers. In 1894, Labor Day became a national holiday.
CATHY: So, people have a day off from work?
MOM: Yes. Many businesses close and companies let people take a day off. Post offices and banks are closed.
CATHY: And, schools are closed, too?
MOM: Yes. Schools are not open on this day either.
CATHY: Is it always in September?
MOM: Yes. It's always the first Monday in September.
CATHY: Do we do anything special on this day?
MOM: Well, now it's also celebrated as the end of summer.
CATHY: Is that why we always have a picnic and get together with family and friends?
MOM: Yes. Some places even have fireworks and parades.
CATHY: I'm glad there is a day to honor hard-working people.
MOM: Yes, Cathy. One day you will also be a hard-working American.
Nicky:  I forgot to buy my mom a birthday gift.
Rhonda:  When is her birthday?

Rhonda:  You only have two hours to find her a birthday present.
Nicky:  I don't get off work until 5:30.

Nicky:  That's a great idea!  I'll go there on my break.
Rhonda:  Remember the gift shop closes at 5 PM.
KATE: Hi Janet. Where are you going with those books?
JANET: To the library. I found these under Joseph's bed.
KATE: Under his bed?
JANET: Yeah. They are all overdue.
KATE: How did you find them?
JANET: We got a notice from the library that he had several overdue books, so I started searching his room.
KATE: How late are they?
JANET: About two months.
KATE: Didn't you receive notices before?
JANET: I found the notices in his room too.
KATE: Why didn't he return them?
JANET: He said he couldn't find them.
KATE: Is he in trouble?
JANET: Of course he's in trouble. He doesn't get to play video games for each book that is late.
KATE: That's five weeks.
JANET: Yes. That's his punishment. He needs to learn not to hide letters that come in the mail. He also needs to learn to clean his room, so things don't get lost.
Alice:  Kelly, your customer is asking for you.
Kelly:  Can you take my table's order?
Alice:  No.  You've been on the phone for 15 minutes.  
Kelly:  It's an important call.
Alice:  We have a lot of customers waiting right now.
Kelly:  It'll be just a few more minutes.

SStan:  Well, our boss didn't give me a raise when I asked for one.
Steve:  Brian, can you cover for me?
Brian:  Again?  I can't keep covering for you.
Steve:  I'm sorry, but I have to leave early today.
Brian:  What is your excuse this time?  
Steve:  I have tickets to the baseball game.
Brian:  You can't leave early for that.
Steve:  Our seats are right behind home plate.
Brian:  You really shouldn't go tonight.
Steve:  Why?
Brian:  Because our boss has tickets for tonight's game.  They are also behind home plate.
Shannon:  Have you read Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare?
Tracy:  Yes.  It's my favorite book.
Shannon:  I've never read it.
Tracy:  You should read it.  I have the book.
Shannon:  Could you lend it to me?
Tracy:  Of course.  Let me know what you think about it.
John:  Let's get a pet.
Elizabeth:  How about a cat?
John:  I was thinking about a dog.
Elizabeth:  Dogs are too much work.
John:  I'm allergic to cats.
Elizabeth:  No, you're not.  You just don't like cats.
Carl:  Let's sell the house.
Wendy:  Why?  I love this house.
Carl:  It's too much work to take care of.
Wendy:  We raised four kids in this house.
Carl:  They're all grown up now.  
Wendy:  There would be no memories in a new house.
Carl:  We would make new memories.
Wendy:  I really don't want to move, Carl.
Carl:  Ok.  I understand.  You talked me out of it.
Dave:  Working late again?
Joseph:  Yeah.  I feel like I live at the office.
Dave:  You should go home on time.
Joseph:  It's not that easy.
Dave:  You need a better work-life balance.
Joseph:  I know.  I have no time for my personal life anymore.
Sophie:  I'm trying to save money to buy a house.
Jane:  When do you want to buy a house?
Sophie:  My long term goal is to save enough to buy one in 10 years.
Jane:  I think you can do it.
Sophie:  I've always wanted my own home.
Jane:  I think you have a very realistic goal.
RUTH: Hi Carol. Have you seen any airline deals lately?
CAROL: Hi Ruth. No, I haven't. Are you planning a trip?
RUTH: Yeah. Stan and I want to visit our daughter in London. She moved there last year.
CAROL: Why?
RUTH: Her job was transferred there.
CAROL: Does she like living there?
RUTH: She loves living in England. She wants us to visit, but the airfare is very expensive.
CAROL: Have you called any travel agencies? Sometimes they have special deals.
RUTH: I've called travel agencies and looked online, but everything is expensive.
CAROL: Yeah, airfare is getting more and more expensive every year.
RUTH: I know. You travel a lot. Where do you buy your airplane tickets?
CAROL: My traveling is for work. My company pays for the tickets.
RUTH: That's nice.
CAROL: Yeah. One of my business trips was to Hawaii. I got to fly in First Class.
RUTH: That's amazing! We rarely travel by plane. I'd rather take the train.
CAROL: Well, you can't take the train across the ocean.
RUTH: I wish we could.
Sharon:  Guess what I heard about Chris.
Esther:  Are you gossiping again?
Sharon:  No.  I'm just sharing news.
Esther:  No.  You're gossiping.
Sharon:  Do you have a problem with it?
Esther:  Yes.  I think it's rude to talk about other people.
Sharon:  What's the big deal?
Esther:  Gossip can hurt people.
Sharon:  I guess I never thought about that.
Esther:  Try to put yourself in their shoes.
BILL: Hey Matt, you're home early today.
MATT: Oh, hi Bill. I got laid off today.
BILL: I'm sorry to hear that. Why?
MATT: The company is downsizing and they eliminated my position.
BILL: That's terrible. How long did you work there?
MATT: 15 years.
BILL: Wow! That's a long time.
MATT: I know. I worked very hard, but I guess it wasn't enough.
BILL: Don't say that. Companies usually downsize because they are losing money.
MATT: I know. I just don't know what to do now. I have a family to take care of.
BILL: Does your wife know?
MATT: Not yet. She's at work. I didn't want to give her bad news there.
BILL: I understand. What kind of work did you do?
MATT: I'm a graphic designer.
BILL: Really? My son is a website developer. Do you know anything about web design?
MATT: That's my specialty.
BILL: Let me give him a call. Maybe he can help you find a job.
MATT: That would be great! I really appreciate it.
Helen:  Hi, Martha.  You look great!
Martha:  Thanks.  I lost 30 pounds.
Helen:  Wow!  How did you lose weight?

Martha:  Once you get started, you'll really enjoy it.

PHIL: Hi Mark. Our dog, Rusty, is lost. Someone left the backyard gate open and he got out.
MARK: Oh no. Let me help you find him.
PHIL: Thanks. My daughter is so upset right now.
MARK: Have you called the local dog shelters?
PHIL: Yeah, they haven't seen him. They said they would call me if they find our dog.
MARK: Does he have any identification on him?
PHIL: Yeah. He's wearing his dog tag and he's also microchipped.
MARK: That's good. Should we make some flyers to post around the neighborhood?
PHIL: My wife is doing that right now.
MARK: How old is Rusty?
PHIL: He's four years old and he's brown with white spots.
MARK: I know what he looks like.
PHIL: Oh, that's right. I'm not thinking straight. I'm just worried he was stolen or is injured somewhere.
MARK: I understand. He's part of your family.
PHIL: Yeah, he's a big part of our family. We got him when he was a little puppy.
MARK: Hey Phil! There he is!
PHIL: Rusty! Come here, boy!

Airline agent:  I'm very sorry.  If we locate it, we will send it to you right away.
SUSAN: Mary, I am so angry!
MARY: What happened, Susan?
SUSAN: Our hotel lost our reservations?
MARY: How did that happen?
SUSAN: I don't know. They didn't have a reasonable explanation.
MARY: Well, can't you just make another reservation?
SUSAN: No. They said there are no more rooms available.
MARY: Oh no! That's terrible.
SUSAN: We are attending my niece's wedding this weekend and everyone is staying at that hotel.
MARY: What about another hotel in that area.
SUSAN: There's going to be a big doctor's conference this weekend. There are no rooms available at any of the nearby hotels.
MARY: Did the hotel apologize?
SUSAN: Yes and they offered us a discount on our next visit.
MARY: Did you accept it?
SUSAN: No. I was so mad. I told them that I would never stay at a place that lost our original reservations.
MARY: What did they say?
SUSAN: They just kept apologizing.
MARY: What are you going to do?
SUSAN: I don't know. My niece is very upset. Our daughter is the photographer.
KATHY: Hi Carol. You look tired today.
CAROL: I am tired. I didn't get any sleep last night.
KATHY: Why?
CAROL: Our neighbor's dog would not stop barking. He barked all night long.
KATHY: That's awful! Did you complain to your neighbor?
CAROL: I knocked on his door, but he didn't answer. I don't think he was home.
KATHY: What did you do all night?
CAROL: I couldn't sleep, so I tried to read a book. But the dog's barking kept distracting me. So, I just watched TV.
KATHY: I would be so angry. You should've called the police.
CAROL: I didn't want to bother the police with a barking dog.
KATHY: I would have called them. What if there was an emergency at your neighbor's house and the dog was trying to alert someone.
CAROL: That's true. I didn't think about that. But this dog usually barks because he's bored.
KATHY: That's annoying.
CAROL: I know.
KATHY: Hey Carol. Is that your neighbor? He's walking towards us.
CAROL: What is he holding?
KATHY: It looks like a plate of cookies.
JOAN: Hi Helen. What's wrong?
HELEN: I couldn't sleep until 3 o'clock in the morning.
JOAN: Why? What happened?
HELEN: Our neighbors' children threw a big party last night. The music was so loud.
JOAN: Wow! Where were their parents?
HELEN: They are on vacation. They left the kids home.
JOAN: How old are the kids?
HELEN: They're teenagers. They're old enough to be home alone.
JOAN: Did you complain to them?
HELEN: Yes! I went over there three times. I told them that their music was too loud and we were trying to sleep.
JOAN: What did they do?
HELEN: Nothing. They wouldn't turn the music down.
JOAN: That is so rude! Why didn't you call the police?
HELEN: I finally did. The police found some of the teens drinking alcohol.
JOAN: I bet that ended the party.
HELEN: Yeah. Now my neighbors are heading back home from their vacation.
JOAN: Do they know what happened?
HELEN: Yes. They are not happy. Those kids are in big trouble.
KATHY: Hey Bill, are you hungry?
BILL: Oh, hi Kathy. Yeah. Let's have lunch.
KATHY: What do you want to eat?
BILL: How about pizza?
KATHY: We always have pizza. Let's try something different.
BILL: Ok. Do you have any suggestions?
KATHY: How about sushi?
BILL: I don't like raw fish.
KATHY: All sushi isn't raw.
BILL: I know. I just don't feel like having sushi today.
KATHY: Ok. Then what should we eat?
BILL: Maybe we should just order take-out. You get sushi and I'll get pizza.
KATHY: That's a good idea. But I think I want Chinese food instead.
BILL: Chinese food sounds yummy.
KATHY: Hey, we agree on something. Let's go out to a Chinese restaurant.
BILL: I'd rather eat at home.
KATHY: We never agree on anything.
Jack:  I'm a little nervous about this business trip.
Kenny:  Why?
Jack:  I'm meeting with the vice-president of the company.  I heard he is a drinker.
Kenny:  So what?
Jack:  I don't drink at all.  I'm afraid he's going to think I'm boring.
Kenny:  Then tell jokes.  I heard he likes funny people.

Emily:  Both of us are sick?
Jane:  Yeah.  We're roommates.  She'll believe it.
Emily:  I feel bad about lying, but I really don't want to go to her party.
Maria:  The economy is stronger.  I think this is a good time to look for another job.
Vicki:  Do you have places to send your resume?
Maria:  No, I don't.  Companies in our industry only hire people that have connections.

A: Oh. You will like Dr. Smith. He is very gentle.
B: That's nice to hear.
A: Is there anything wrong with your teeth?
B: I have a toothache.
A: We have an opening tomorrow morning at 9 am.
B: Do you have anything this afternoon. My tooth hurts very much.
A: We are very busy this afternoon, but I can squeeze you in around 4 pm. Does that work for you?
B: Yes! 4 pm is perfect.
A: Do you have dental insurance?

A: You're welcome. We'll see you soon.
B: Bye.

Zoey:  Sure.  What time?
Arnold:  How about 6 PM?
Zoey:  That's perfect.  I get off work at 5:30.
Arnold:  I can pick you up at your apartment.
Zoey:  There is a lot of construction going on in my neighborhood.  Let's just meet at the restaurant.
Arnold:  Ok.  What kind of food do you like?
Zoey:  I like all kinds of food.
Arnold:  There's a great Italian place downtown.
Zoey:  Sounds good.  Let's go there.  
Mary:  Sharon, I've been looking for you.
Sharon:  Is there a problem?
Mary:  No.  I need someone to pick up a client from the airport on Saturday.
Sharon:  I thought Greg was doing that.
Mary:  He says he has to visit his parents this weekend.
Sharon:  He didn't mention that to me.
Mary:  Are you busy this Saturday?
Sharon:  I'm sorry.  I just got an urgent email.  I need to reply immediately.
Mary:  I see.  I will talk to you later then.
Sharon:  I'll be busy meeting clients all day.
BILL: Hey Carl, what are you doing with all that wood?
CARL: Hi Bill. I'm going to make a coffee table for Jill.
BILL: That's nice! You know how to build things with wood?
CARL: Yeah. We just got back from furniture shopping and the price of furniture is expensive.
BILL: So, you're going to make a coffee table instead of buying one?
CARL: That's right. Furniture is too expensive these days.
BILL: You're lucky you know how to build things.
CARL: My dad used to make furniture when he was younger. He taught me a lot.
BILL: Hey, could you make me something if I pay you?
CARL: Sure. What is it?
BILL: Carol has been asking for a new desk. Can you build a desk?
CARL: Yeah. I built a desk for my daughter when she was in college. She still has it.
BILL: How much would you charge me?
CARL: It depends on what kind of desk you want. Show me a picture later.
BILL: Ok! I'll ask Carol to find a picture.
CARL: Maybe I should quit being an accountant and go into furniture making instead.
Jeff:  Kathy should be here soon.
Steven:  Ok.  I'm not in a hurry.
Jeff:  Is this your first trip to Seattle?
Steven:  Yes.    
Jeff:  How do you like Seattle?
Steven:  It's a lovely city.  I just don't like the rain.
Jessica:  Why does everyone look nervous?

JEFF: Hello?
CARL: Hi Jeff. This is Carl. Have you finished the math assignment?

CARL: No, my parents said I cannot have any friends over when I'm babysitting.
JEFF: I see. Do you want to discuss it over the phone?
CARL: Ok. What have you done so far?
JEFF: Nothing. I didn't know where to begin.
CARL: Me too. I wrote some things, and then I erased it. It didn't make any sense.
JEFF: What are we going to do?
CARL: Can you ask your parents?
JEFF: No. They're not home either.
CARL: Let's call Lucy. She's really good in math. She'll have the answer.

SUSAN: Hi Barbara. I think I did well. It was pretty easy.
BARBARA: Really? It was very hard for me. I'm having a hard time in this class.
SUSAN: I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you should get a tutor.
BARBARA: A tutor?
SUSAN: Yeah, I had a tutor last year and she helped me a lot.
BARBARA: That sounds like a great idea. Could I have your tutor's phone number?
SUSAN: Unfortunately, she doesn't live in this state anymore. She moved away for college.
BARBARA: Ok. That's too bad. I don't know where to look.
SUSAN: I can ask my mom. She knows a couple of local college students.

BILLY: Me too! But, why do we have that day off?

SAM: It's Memorial Day. This is the day we remember the people who died serving in the United States military.

SAM: It's an important day. It's not just a day off from school and work.
BILLY: I see. Is it always in May?
SAM: Yeah. It's always observed on the last Monday in May.
BILLY: I just thought it was another day off from school. I'm glad to know what this day means now.
SAM: It's really important in our family. My grandfather and great grandfather both served in the United States army. They both died serving this country.
BILLY: Do you do anything special on this day?
SAM: Each year my family and I go to the cemetery and place flowers on their graves.
BILLY: I've never been to a cemetery before. Is it scary?
SAM: No. We go every year, so it's not scary anymore.
BILLY: Do all schools close on this day.
SAM: I think so. But only in the United States. It's an American holiday. Some businesses like post offices and banks close too.
BILLY: Thanks for telling me what Memorial Day means. I'm going to go home and ask my brother if he knows.

Charlie:  Unless we get laid off during the process.
Nathan:  Why do you have to be so negative? 
Robert:  I don't think we can be roommates anymore.

MOM: No, Mary. Where did you last see it?

MOM: Don't worry. We'll find it. Let's look for it together.
MARY: But I didn't take it off my desk.

MOM: You go check outside and I'll check the kitchen.
MARY: Ok.
MOM: Mary.
MARY: Yes, Mom?

MOM: How did it get there?

MOM: You must be studying too hard. Take another break.

BILL: Yeah. I said something silly and hurt her feelings.
JOE: What did you say?
BILL: It's not important. I don't want to discuss it. I just want to apologize to her.
JOE: She always hangs out at Linda's house or the library.
BILL: I've already checked both places.
JOE: How about her house.
BILL: Her roommate said she wasn't home.
JOE: Have you called her cell phone.
BILL: Yeah, several times.
JOE: She must really be mad at you.
BILL: She was! She stormed off and I didn't get to explain what I meant.
JOE: I'm really curious now. What did you say to her?
BILL: I told her to exercise.
JOE: Well, that probably wasn't a smart thing to say to a woman.
BILL: I meant that she should exercise to stay healthy.
JOE: That sounds better. Hope you find her.

Josh:  What do you mean?
Cory:  I think you're spoiled.  You need to set some priorities.
JASON: Let's have another backyard barbeque this weekend.
JANE: Ok. That sounds fun. Should we invite some friends?
JASON: Yeah, let's invite a few couples.
JANE: OK. But we should buy some mosquito repellent this time.
JASON: That's a good idea!
JANE: Do you remember what happened last time?
JASON: Yeah. Everyone was bitten by mosquitoes.
JANE: It was awful. We were itchy for days.
JASON: We used so much anti-itch cream.
JANE: I think there are special candles that keep mosquitoes away. I saw a commercial for it a couple of days ago.
JASON: Let's get those.
JANE: Ok, I'll put it on the shopping list for the barbeque.
JASON: Do you think our friends will come back to our party?
JANE: We'll have to tell them we have mosquito repellent this time.

Roy:  That's too bad.  Just try to do your best in your new position.
Hal:  I need to change my desk location.
Brendon:  What's wrong?
Hal:  David has an annoying habit of singing while he's working.
Brendon:  That's weird.
Hal:  I know.  It's so distracting too.
Brendon:  Have you talked to him?
Hal:  Yes, but he keeps doing it.
Brendon:  That's rude.
Hal:  I don't think David hears himself.  He always has earphones on.

Susan:  Hopefully in 7 years.  I'll be thirty years old then.
Tina:  Let me know if you need an accountant.  I'm great with numbers.
MIKE: I think I need a new computer.
GARY: Why?
MIKE: Mine is so slow now. It takes a long time to start up and it keeps freezing.
GARY: That's not good. How old is it?
MIKE: Several years old. It was a high school graduation gift from my parents.
GARY: Yeah, it's probably time to replace it.
MIKE: I don't know what to buy. There are so many different models these days.
GARY: You should go to a computer store and ask about the different kinds?
MIKE: That's a good idea. Do you want to go with me?
GARY: When? I have to work today. Can you wait until tomorrow?
MIKE: Sure. I have to work until 5 pm tomorrow. Can you go around 6 o'clock tomorrow evening?
GARY: Yeah. Let's meet at your place at 6 pm.
MIKE: Ok. I'll do some research on computers tonight.

LINDA: Something is wrong with my refrigerator.
SUE: What's wrong with it?
LINDA: It's not staying cold.
SUE: That could be a big problem.
LINDA: I know. I'm worried that my food is going to spoil. I just went grocery shopping yesterday.
SUE: I have room in my second refrigerator if you need to store some things.
LINDA: You have two refrigerators?
SUE: Yeah. We needed two refrigerators because I cook a lot. There was a big sale at the appliance store, so we bought another one last week.
LINDA: Is the sale still going on? I may need to buy a new one.
SUE: Today is the last day of the sale.
LINDA: Then I better tell my husband. We need to go today.
SUE: Isn't your husband a great repairman. Maybe he can fix your refrigerator.
LINDA: It's getting old. I'd rather buy a new one.
SUE: If your husband can fix your broken one, you can have two refrigerators like me.
LINDA: I don't cook that much.

Cathy:  She's not easy to negotiate with.
Gary:  I've worked here for two years and haven't received a raise yet.
Cathy:  She's not good at giving raises.  
Gary:  Well, that needs to change.  Do you have any tips for me?
Cathy:  Talk fast.  She's very impatient.
Gary:  I know exactly what I'm going to say and I'm ready!
Cathy:  Ok!  Good luck and let me know what happens.
Customer:  How much is the delivery charge?

Patrick:  I would be nervous too.
Tina:  I hope I don't say anything stupid.
Patrick:  You're smart.  Don't worry.
Tina:  When I'm nervous, I say silly things.
Patrick:  At least it's a phone call.  She can't see you.
Tina:  It's a video conference call.  She will be able to see me.
Patrick:  Oh.  Just look confident.
SEAN: Can I tell you a secret, Alison?
ALISON: Sure. What is it, Sean? Is something wrong?
SEAN: I'm afraid to graduate.
ALISON: Why? That's silly.
SEAN: College was easy for me. Now we have to go out and find a real job.
ALISON: That's the best part. We are finally adults.
SEAN: Aren't you scared at all?
ALISON: No. I'm excited to work and plan my future.
SEAN: I feel so immature.
ALISON: Well, you are acting a little immature. It's time to grow up, Sean.
SEAN: I know. Studying and taking tests were easy. Now we have to work for the rest of our lives.
ALISON: You sound lazy. You're a really smart guy. You're going to have a great life.
SEAN: Thanks for your encouragement. I feel silly.
ALISON: You are being silly. If you are so scared of leaving school, why don't you go to graduate school?
SEAN: That's a great idea!
ALISON: It actually is. You'll get a better job with a graduate degree.

JOAN: Do you want to go together?
CAROL: Sure. I don't need a new appliance, but I would love to update my washer and dryer one day.
JOAN: I just bought a new washer and dryer set. I love it!
CAROL: I'm jealous. My set is really old. It takes a long time to wash and dry.
JOAN: You should really look into upgrading your set. It can save you money?
CAROL: How can it save me money?
JOAN: The new washers use less water and the dryers uses less energy.
CAROL: Really? Maybe it's time for an upgrade.
JOAN: I can show you what I bought.
CAROL: That would great! Maybe it will be on sale.
JOAN: I wish I knew about the new store when I bought my set. I paid full price for mine.
CAROL: You didn't buy it on sale?
JOAN: No, I was foolish.
CAROL: I'm not jealous anymore.
JOAN: Let's go check out the new store.
Olivia:  Have you met the company's new CEO?
Madison:  No.  Have you?
Olivia:  Yes.  She's very nice.

MOM: You have an aunt who lives in Seattle.
JANE: I know. I like Seattle. It's beautiful there, but it rains too much.
MOM: Yeah. That's why we're staying in sunny California.
JANE: Cindy and I have a lot in common. We both like drawing, playing with dogs, and eating pizza.
MOM: You should invite her over for dinner one night.

MOM: Sure. We can order pizza.
JANE: Maybe I'll ask her if she can come over on Friday.

Dan:  You're just going to waste your money.

SALLY: No. I'm going to my parents' house. I'm going to watch the Rose Bowl on TV with my dad. It's our annual tradition.
SUE: What is the Rose Bowl?
SALLY: You've never heard of the Rose Bowl? It's a big American college football game. It's played every January 1.
SUE: We don't watch that much football in our house.
SALLY: Have you ever watched the Tournament of Roses parade?
SUE: No. What is that?
SALLY: It's a big parade that is shown before the football game. It's America's New Year celebration.

SALLY: Well, I better go now. Happy New Year, Sue!
SUE: Happy New Year, Sally!
HELEN: I can't believe tomorrow is the first day of the New Year!
JANE: I know! 2015 went by so fast.
HELEN: It did. Have you made a New Year's resolution yet?
JANE: What is that?
HELEN: A goal you want to set or achieve in the New Year. Haven't you ever made a New Year's resolution?
JANE: No. Do you make one every year?
HELEN: Yes!
JANE: Do you achieve your goal every year?
HELEN: No, I hardly ever achieve them.
JANE: What were they?
HELEN: One year was losing weight. Another year, I was going to quit smoking. There are too many to list.
JANE: If you can't achieve them, why do you make one every year?
HELEN: I should at least try to achieve one goal.
JANE: Was there ever a successful resolution?
HELEN: Let me think about it. I don't think so.
JANE: Then your resolution for the New Year should be not to make any more resolutions.
HELEN: Great idea!
Linda:  Do we have a company dress code?
Susan:  No.  The president of the company doesn't care how you dress.
Linda:  Really?  You can wear jeans and t-shirts or shorts?
Susan:  Yeah.  He only cares about the quality of your work.
Linda:  That's great!  We had to wear suits to work every day at my old job.
Susan:  Even on Fridays?
Linda:  Yeah.  Our president was very conservative.
Susan:  Was that uncomfortable?
Linda:  Yes!  Wearing pantyhose every day is very uncomfortable.
Susan:  I know!

Barry:  Wow!  We don't get any of those.  
Henry:  I know.  
Barry:  Maybe we should try to get a job there.

Barry:  Why?
Henry:  There are thousands of applicants every month.
Emma:  I'm so stressed right now.
Stella:  Why?  Is there something wrong?
Emma:  I'm so busy at work.  I'm forgetting about my personal life.
Stella:  I understand.  That happened to me too.
Emma:  How do you balance it all out?
Stella:  I just set a strict schedule.  Work is work and home is home.
Emma:  It's not that easy.
Stella:  I know.  But if you don't do that, you're going to get sick.
Emma:  I think that's my problem.  I feel sick all the time.
Michael:  Are you sick?
Nick:  No.  I just ate too much.
Michael:  Why do you always eat so much?

MARK: I'm hoping Jonathan saves and saves.
PETER: Now my older son always borrows money from his younger brother.
MARK: Wow! Does your younger son loan him money?

LINDA: No, I'm not. Why?
STACY: I'm inviting a couple of friends to sleep over.
LINDA: I wish I could go, but I have to babysit my younger sister.

LINDA: Now I really wish I could go. That sounds like so much fun.

Colleen:  Be patient.  It's a very old building.
JANE: Hi Carol. Did you get a new car?
CAROL: Hi Jane. No, this is a rental car. I was in an auto accident yesterday.
JANE: Are you ok?
CAROL: Yeah. My back hurts a little, but luckily I wasn't seriously injured.
JANE: Did you go to the hospital?
CAROL: Yeah. I went there this morning. The doctor took some did x-rays. Nothing is serious. I just have some bruises.
JANE: I'm glad you are ok. Was there another car involved?
CAROL: Yeah, the other driver rear-ended me at a red light.
JANE: Wow! Is he or she ok?
CAROL: Yeah. He seemed ok at the scene.
JANE: This could've been a serious accident.
CAROL: I know. We were both lucky.
JANE: Where is your car? Is it getting fixed?
CAROL: No. It's too damaged to be repaired. It's at the junkyard now.
JANE: That's terrible. Is your insurance going to pay for a new car?
CAROL: Well, it was the other driver's fault, so his insurance is going to take care of it.
JANE: That's good. Are you going to buy the same type of car?
CAROL: I think so. I loved that car. It protected me in this accident.
MATTHEW: I like your sports jersey.
KAREN: Thanks! You must be a fan too.

ALICE: Has Bus 47 come yet?
TOM: No. I think it's late today.
ALICE: Do you ride this bus every day?
TOM: Yeah. Do you?
ALICE: Not every day. Only a couple of times a week.
TOM: Well, I think the bus is late today because of the rain.
ALICE: Oh. Does the weather make a difference?
TOM: Yes. The bus is usually several minutes late when it rains.
ALICE: Because of bad traffic?
TOM: Yeah and probably because of car accidents.
ALICE: That makes sense. I must have picked the wrong day to ride the bus.
TOM: Actually, I think riding the bus on rainy days is better.
ALICE: Why?
TOM: Then you don't have to drive in bad traffic. Someone is driving for you.
ALICE: You are totally right! I'm going to check the weather from now on. I'm going to take the bus when it rains.
TOM: Then I'll see you here at the bus stop.
ALICE: Great! It was nice talking with you.
TOM: Yes, it was. I think our bus is coming now.

Sam:  Do you know how to use one?
Jonathan:  No, but I can learn.
Sam:  You don't even know how to use your smartphone.

Sam:  Maybe you should learn how to use your phone first.
DAVID: Did you watch the soccer game yesterday?
CATHY: Yeah, I watched it at the arena.
DAVID: You went to the game?
CATHY: Yeah, I went with my co-workers.
DAVID: It was a good game to watch. It was really close.
CATHY: I know. We were all screaming. The crowd was out of control.
DAVID: Were people getting angry?
CATHY: Yeah. It was getting a little scary. The security guards came and escorted someone out of the arena.
DAVID: Why?
CATHY: He got really drunk and was cursing at everyone.
DAVID: That's crazy! People like that always ruin the fun for everyone.
CATHY: I agree. He was out of control. He threw beer on a stranger.
DAVID: Wow!
CATHY: The stranger stayed calm. But it was a good thing security came.
DAVID: I would've been so upset.
CATHY: Yeah, everyone was getting really upset at the drunk guy. That's why security was called.
DAVID: Sounds like it was an interesting game.
CATHY: It really was. I don't know if I want to go to another game for a while.
DAVID: At least our team won.
James:  Are you ready for the business trip?
Paul:  Yeah.  I'm a little nervous.
James:  Is this your first business trip?
Paul:  No.  I just don't know any of these people.  Do you have any advice for me?
James:  Just socialize.  Get to know them.  Go out for drinks one night.
Paul:  Actually, two of our clients are taking me out for drinks the first night.
James:  That's good.  Don't stress about it so much.
Paul:  I want to make a good first impression.
James:  Then don't get drunk.
Paul:  What if I get nervous and drink too much.
James:  Then you'll have more things to worry about.
JOE: Hi Carol. What are you looking for?
CAROL: Oh hi Joe. I'm looking for some materials to make a solar system.
JOE: A solar system?
CAROL: Yeah, David has a science project. He has to make a model of the solar system with the sun and the planets.
JOE: How about some balls? They can represent the planets and the sun.
CAROL: I was looking for some foam balls, but I can't find any in our garage.
JOE: I might have some. Judy had to make a solar system model a few years ago. I might have some balls left over.
CAROL: That would be great! David wants to paint them and glue them on a black poster board.
JOE: That's what Judy did too.
CAROL: Was Judy in Mrs. Johnson's science class?
JOE: Yes!
CAROL: She must have the students do the same project every year.
JOE: It's a great project. We had a fun time doing it together.
CAROL: Are there eight or nine planets now? When I was a child, Pluto was a planet. But it's not considered a major planet anymore.
JOE: I know. I think scientists are still debating that issue. David should ask his teacher.
CAROL: Good idea.
JOE: Let me go look for the balls. I think I still have her model in the garage too. I'll be right back.
CAROL: Thank you! I'll keep looking in my garage too.
Ben:  We go to the mountains every year.
Cynthia:  Do you want to try something different this year?
Ben:  Let's go somewhere warm. 
Cynthia:  Where should we go?
Ben:  How about the beach?  My co-worker owns a condo on the beach.
Cynthia:  That sounds nice.
Ben:  He said he would give us a discount on the cost.
Cynthia:  We can celebrate our anniversary there.
Ben:  That's a great idea!
Cynthia:  We haven't been to the beach in a long time.
BOB: Hey Steve. Where are you going with all of that baseball gear?
STEVE: Oh, hi Bob. I coach my son's baseball team. We're having our first practice today.
BOB: How old is your son?
STEVE: 8 years old. He's been playing baseball for a couple of years.
BOB: Does he like it?
STEVE: He loves it! This is my first year as a coach. I'm pretty excited.
BOB: It sounds exciting. I used to play baseball in college.
STEVE: What position did you play?
BOB: Pitcher. But I had to quit because of a shoulder injury.
STEVE: That's too bad. Do you miss it?
BOB: Not anymore. I'm too old to play now.
STEVE: My son is a pitcher too. Maybe you can give him some tips on how to throw.
BOB: Sure. I'm always free in the afternoon.
STEVE: We have our first game next Saturday. Would you like to come and watch?
BOB: That would be fun. What time is the game?
STEVE: 10 am.
BOB: Ok. Can I bring my wife?
STEVE: Of course.
TOM: My son is taking his driver's license test today.
BILL: Is he nervous?
TOM: He's a little nervous.
BILL: It's normal to be nervous.
TOM: I told him that. He just wants to pass the test, so he can start driving to school.
BILL: Does he have a car?
TOM: No, he has to share with my wife.
BILL: Are you going to get him a car?
TOM: No, not yet. First, he has to show us that he is a responsible driver.
BILL: Did your auto insurance go up a lot?
TOM: Yes! Our insurance rate doubled.
BILL: Wow! Are you serious?
TOM: Yes, that's what makes me nervous. I don't know how we'll be able to afford insurance when my younger son starts to drive.
BILL: When will that be?
TOM: In two years.
BILL: Better start saving or better have your sons get part-time jobs.
TOM: I think I like the part-time job idea better.
Raul:  Are you ready for the English test tomorrow?
June:  No.  I am going to fail it.
Raul:  Didn't you study and take notes?
June:  My notes will not help me.
Raul:  Why?
June:  The teacher speaks too fast.  I couldn't write anything down.
Raul:  Why didn't you ask her to speak slowly?
June:  I was too embarrassed to tell her I didn't understand.  
Raul:  I'll help you study.  I have a lot of notes.
Lou:  We have a lot to do on this presentation.
Doug:  I know.  Should we divide the work?

Doug:  Ok.  I'll work on the presentation style.
Lou:  Great!  
Doug:  We make a good team.
RICK: Hey Joe. What are you doing for Spring Break?
JOE: I'm going to Florida with some friends. Do you want to join us, Rick?

JOE: Cool.
RICK: Let me call my parents. I'll text you later.
JOE: Ok. It's going to be fun.
SHARON: Hi Jill. What are you doing today?
JILL: Hi Sharon. Today we are doing our annual spring cleaning.
SHARON: What is that?
JILL: It's the day we thoroughly clean the whole house. We throw away things we don't need, pack up things to donate, clean all of the rooms, and wash all of the windows.
SHARON: Wow! That's a lot to do.
JILL: Yeah. It takes all day.
SHARON: Do your kids help too.
JILL: Of course. They look through their closets and toy bins to find clothes and toys to donate or throw away.
SHARON: That's a great idea! But why is it called spring cleaning?
JILL: Because it's done in the spring season.
SHARON: I see. I think we're going to start doing this too. Our house is so cluttered.
JILL: After we have the things ready for donation, Jim takes them to the local homeless shelter. This makes the house easier to clean.
SHARON: That's great! I'm going to tell my family about this.
JILL: Well, I better get started. I have a lot to do. Talk to you later, Sharon.
SHARON: Bye, Jill. Thanks for the cleaning tip.

SUSIE: Yeah. It was a lot of fun. But now my tummy hurts.
MOMMY: Did you eat too much food at the party?
SUSIE: I think so.
MOMMY: What did you eat?
SUSIE: Pizza, cake, ice cream, and potato chips.
MOMMY: That is a lot of food.
SUSIE: I also had soda, cookies, and popcorn.
MOMMY: Susie, that's why your stomach hurts. You ate too much. Why did you eat so much?
SUSIE: I was hungry and everything looked delicious.
MOMMY: Susie, I think you should go lie down for a while?
SUSIE: Ok, mommy.
MOMMY: Susie, where are you going?
SUSIE: I need to go to the bathroom first.

Ian:  Ok.  I will see you soon.

HELEN: Hi Diane. This is Helen.
DIANE: Hi Helen. What's up?
HELEN: I want to throw Mom a surprise birthday party.
DIANE: That's wonderful idea. How can I help?
HELEN: Do you know who we should invite?
DIANE: Her friends and co-workers?
HELEN: Do you have their phone numbers or e-mail addresses?
DIANE: No, I don't. Why don't we ask Dad? He should have them.
HELEN: Do you think Dad can keep a secret?
DIANE: Yeah. Remember he surprised her with a trip to France a couple of years ago?
HELEN: Oh yeah. Mom was so surprised.
DIANE: What kind of food should we serve?
HELEN: Let's serve Mom's favorite food, pasta. I can cook.
DIANE: Ok. I can take care of the party decorations.
HELEN: Perfect. Should we get together to discuss all of the plans?

HELEN: Why don't you come to my house? I can make us dinner.
KATHY: Hello?
MOM: Hi Kathy. This is Mom. Are you and Phil free on Friday night?
KATHY: We're having dinner with friends. Why? What's going on?
MOM: Your dad's co-workers are throwing him a surprise retirement party.
KATHY: Really? That's so nice of them.
MOM: I know. I was hoping you and Phil could attend.
KATHY: Of course we will. I'll reschedule the dinner party.
MOM: That would be wonderful. But remember it's a surprise. So, don't tell him.
KATHY: I won't. Is Dad sad about retiring?
MOM: No. He is actually looking forward to it. He has worked a long time.
KATHY: Yeah. I remember all of those long hours he worked.
MOM: He was a great employee. They're going to miss him at the office.
KATHY: What are you and Dad going to do now?
MOM: I think we're going to take a trip to Hawaii.
KATHY: That's good! It's a great place to relax.
MOM: It sure is. We even talked about retiring there.
KATHY: Really? That would be awesome!
MOM: You and your family could vacation in Hawaii. You'll have a free place to stay.
KATHY: Mom, that sounds awesome. But I'll miss you both.
MOM: Yeah, that's the only bad thing.
Anna:  Are you going to the hospitality event?
Joann:  Yes.  I have a few clients attending. 
Anna:  Great!  This year we're doing a raffle and gift bags.
Joann:  Raffle and gift bags?  Isn't that a little childish?
Anna:  The raffle prize is a sports car and the gift bags are filled with jewelry.
Joann:  Are you serious?  Can our company afford this?
Anna:  The CEO wants to keep our clients happy.  
Joann:  That's definitely going to keep them happy.
Anna:  It'll probably attract more clients to our company too.
Sean:  I need some tips on negotiating.
Glen:  Ok.  Don't be in a hurry to end negotiations.
Sean:  Why?  I hate negotiating.  I want it to be over quickly.
Glen:  If you're in a rush, you're more likely to make mistakes.
Sean:  That's true.  I made a bad deal once because I was in a hurry.
Glen:  If you show them patience, they will think you are not under pressure to make a quick deal.  They will start to give you what you want because they think you don't need their offer.
Sean:  That's also true.  This is great advice.
Glen:  Just take your time.  There's a lot of money involved, so you don't want to make any mistakes in your negotiations.
Sean:  Thank you!  These are great negotiating tips!
Erin:  Where should we go this summer?
Ryan:  Let's take a cruise.
Erin:  I'm afraid of the ocean.
Ryan:  Why?
Erin:  What if the ship sinks?
Ryan:  You shouldn't say that.  That's bad luck.
Erin:  Also, there are sharks in the ocean.
Ryan:  You won't be swimming in the ocean.
Erin:  If the ship sinks, we will.
Ryan:  You are being silly.  Let's just stay in a hotel with a pool.

Michael:  Thank you for understanding.
Andrew:  I have two dogs.  They're the best.  
Kevin:  Is Richard in his office?
Sharon:  No.  He's in a meeting.
Kevin:  I need to talk to him about my start time.  I need to start an hour later.
Sharon:  Why?
Kevin:  Sheila is going back to work and I need to be home until my son leaves for school.
Sharon:  I'm sure Richard will be fine with that.  He's a single dad, so he will understand.
ALICE: You take such good care of your plants, Joan.
JOAN: I try my best. I love plants.
ALICE: I have killed every plant I have ever owned.
JOAN: How, Alice?
ALICE: I don't know. I water them and make sure they get enough sun, but they still die.
JOAN: That's strange.
ALICE: I know. I don't buy plants anymore.
JOAN: That's sad. Plants are beautiful and they provide oxygen too.
ALICE: Can you teach me how to care for plants?
JOAN: Sure. I'm going on vacation tomorrow. I'll be gone for a couple of weeks. We can start after I get back.
ALICE: Ok! Can we shop for the plants together?
JOAN: Yes. Let's get a couple of plants that require low maintenance.
ALICE: What do you mean by low maintenance?
JOAN: Plants that don't need much attention.
ALICE: That will be perfect for me.
JOAN: I'll make a list of good plants to start with.
ALICE: What are you going to do about all of your plants while you're on vacation?
JOAN: Well, I was going to ask you to water them for me, but I think I'll ask my sister instead.
ALICE: Yeah, that's a good idea.
Mike:  I have to leave work early today.
Nick:  We're not done with the project.

Matt:  Where do I drop him off?
Catherine:  His hotel is downtown.
Matt:  Downtown?  I need to come back downtown during rush hour?
Catherine:  Yes, please.  Would you also be able to take him out to dinner?

Catherine:  Yes.   You can borrow the company car.
Kelly:  I can't understand why everyone is so mad at John.
Fiona:  He was rude to Tom.
Kelly:  I don't think he was rude.  
Fiona:  He said mean things to Tom.
Kelly:  Tom asked John a question.
Fiona:  John didn't have to be so honest.
Kelly:  John was just telling the truth.
Fiona:  Sometimes the truth is painful.
Kelly:  Then you shouldn't ask questions.
Fiona:  I can't understand why you are on John's side.
Polly:  Can you take the kids to school today?  
Hal:  Sure.  
Polly:  The plumber is coming at 8 AM.  I need to be home.
Hal:  Ok.  Do I drop Kevin off first?
Polly:  Yes.  When you drop Katie off, you have to walk her to her classroom.
Hal:  Why?
Polly:  Because she is in kindergarten and the school does not allow them to be dropped off in the parking lot.
Hal:  That's right.  I forgot.  
Polly:  Looks like you need to drop the kids off at school more often.
Hal:  I think they need to take the bus to school.

Lucia:  We're on the 18th floor!
Patrick:  I don't care.  I'm going to be late for work.
Lucia:  I'll come with you.
Patrick:  Ok, but you're wearing high heels.
Lucia:  I'll wait for the elevator.
Patrick:  Good luck.
James:  How was the concert?
Karen:  It was great!  The band was amazing!

KATE: Hello?
ANNE: Hi Kate. This is Anne. Have you completed the class project?
KATE: Yeah. I finished it last night. How about you?
ANNE: No, not yet. I'm having a hard time with the conclusion of my report.
KATE: Do you need any help?
ANNE: Maybe just a little. Do you have time tonight?
KATE: No. I'm sorry. It's my aunt and uncle's anniversary and I promised to babysit my niece.
ANNE: Oh. I understand.
KATE: I'm free tomorrow night.
ANNE: Tomorrow is good for me too. Can I come over or would you like to come here.

DAVE: I don't have any plans for the summer. I can help you if you need it.
JACK: Thanks. That would be nice.
DAVE: Do you know when summer school starts?

STEVE: Sure. Wait, John!
JOHN: Steve, what?
STEVE: Something is pulling on your fishing pole! Here, grab it!

ANNE: Why? Did he cut himself?
KATE: Yeah, he was slicing some onions and the knife slipped. He got a really deep cut on his finger.
ANNE: That sounds painful.
KATE: The painful part was waiting at the emergency room. There was only one doctor working tonight. We waited three hours.
ANNE: What about his finger?
KATE: The nurse wrapped it with a bandage to stop the bleeding.
ANNE: I hate the ER. It is always crowded and takes too long.
KATE: I know.  But, I knew he had to have stitches. It was a really bad cut, so we had to stay.
ANNE: How many stitches did he get?
KATE: Nine. He won't be able to play video games for a few weeks.
ANNE: Is that a good thing?
KATE: Actually, it is. But he's not happy about it.

BOBBY: Hey Steve, what did your mom pack for your lunch today?

STEVE: I love tuna sandwiches. Do you want to trade?
BOBBY: Sure! But will your mom get mad?
STEVE: No. She won't know. I won't tell her.
BOBBY: Do you ever buy the school lunch?
STEVE: No, it looks gross.
BOBBY: It's actually not bad. Some dishes are pretty good.
STEVE: Which ones have you tried?
BOBBY: The spaghetti and pizza are good. But the hamburgers and burritos are terrible. They taste like cardboard.
STEVE: That's awful! Maybe I'll buy lunch when the cafeteria serves spaghetti and pizza. Those are my favorite dishes at home.
BOBBY: They're pretty good, but not as good as our moms' cooking.
STEVE: Are you done with lunch? Let's go out to recess.
BOBBY: Yeah. Let's go!

ASHLEY: Of course, that's his job. And, he would love the commission.
KATE: Where does he work?
ASHLEY: Downtown. I can go with you when you're ready to buy a car.
KATE: I need to save a little more money first. It's a big purchase.
ASHLEY: I know. I don't think I can go out to dinner for a while.
KATE: Yeah, it's expensive to eat out all the time.
ASHLEY: I better learn how to cook.

LINDA: Then he's going to love this ride.
KATHY: I know. We haven't told him yet. It's going to be a surprise.
LINDA: I remember riding the train as a child. It was a lot of fun.

TINA: Then she has to wait another year.
JAN: Maybe Janice can talk to her.
TINA: Where are you and Janice going?
JAN: Just around our neighborhood. There are a lot of homes around here.
TINA: We live in an apartment. Maybe that's why it's boring. There aren't many kids here.

Esther:  He is my favorite actor.  
Pat:  He is a good actor, but he is not very popular.
Esther:  He is so underrated.  
Pat:  Why is he underrated?
Esther:  I think it is because he's not very handsome.
Pat:  I don't think that is true.  There are many popular actors who are not handsome.
Esther:  Maybe it is because he always plays the bad guy.  People like good guys.
Pat:  He is very good at playing an evil guy.
Esther:  That is what makes him a great actor.
Pat:  But he needs to play other types of roles.
Shannon:  I love this restaurant.  
Bill:  Me too.  It is so underrated.
Shannon:  I agree.  Not too many people know about it.
Bill:  People do not know how great the food is here.
Shannon:  Don't tell anyone.  This place will get crowded.  I hate crowded places.
Bill:  Me too.  However, if this place doesn't get more customers, they may go out of business.

ANNE: Yes. It's on October 31.
SUE: What do people do on that day?
ANNE: People dress up in costumes and go to other people's homes to collect candy.
SUE: Even strangers' homes?
ANNE: Yes. They knock on the doors and say 'Trick or Treat.' Then the home owner gives out candy.
SUE: Do adults do it, too?
ANNE: Not many adults. It's usually just children.
SUE: Isn't that unsafe?
ANNE: It can be. But parents go with them.
SUE: I see. My son wants to do it this year. I didn't know what it was.
ANNE: You don't do this in your native country?

LEE: Hey John, what are you doing?
JOHN: Oh, hi Lee. I'm setting up tables and chairs for a family BBQ.

JOHN: Tomorrow is the fourth of July.
LEE: I know that tomorrow is July 4, but what is so important about it?
JOHN: You don't know. It's our country's Independence Day.
LEE: What do you mean Independence Day?
JOHN: On July 4, 1776, our country's founders declared independence from the rulers of Great Britain.
LEE: How did America declare independence?
JOHN: We went to war against Great Britain called the Revolutionary War and won.
LEE: Wow! I didn't know that.
JOHN: Yeah. So, now the United States celebrates this day every year.
LEE: How do you celebrate?
JOHN: We usually have a big BBQ party. Then we light fireworks when it gets dark.
LEE: Oh, those loud and colorful explosions in the sky?
JOHN: Yeah. Would you like to come over and watch them with our family?
LEE: Sure. Can I bring my children, too?
JOHN: Of course. They will enjoy them. But it is very dangerous, so we have to watch the kids carefully.
SUE: Hi Anne.
ANNE: Hi Sue.
SUE: I have a question about Thanksgiving. What does that day mean?
ANNE: It's an American holiday that's celebrated once a year.
SUE: What is the date?
ANNE: There is no actual date. It is different every year. It is on the fourth Thursday in November.
SUE: That's interesting. Why do Americans celebrate this day?
ANNE: It first started many years ago after the pilgrims settled in America. They wanted to celebrate the first harvest after settling in America.
SUE: Oh, I see. Is there anything special Americans do on that day like fireworks on the 4th of July?
ANNE: We typically roast a whole turkey and make lots of other dishes like potatoes and stuffing.
SUE: Wow! That sounds like a feast. Can your family eat all of that?
ANNE: We invite our relatives and celebrate this day together.
SUE: It's like a family reunion.
ANNE: It is! And, pumpkin pie is usually the dessert because pumpkins are in season in the Fall.
SUE: It sounds like a nice tradition.
ANNE: Nowadays, many people celebrate this day to give thanks for all of their blessings like family and good health.
SUE: I like this tradition. Maybe I will roast a turkey this year. Will you teach me?
ANNE: Sure. I would love to. I have many great recipes I can share with you.
