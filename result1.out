Christian talks about a job he would like to have in the future.

Christian (Norway)
Todd (USA)
Todd: OK, Christian, what is your dream job, if you could have any job in the world?
Christian: My dream job is to become a diplomat representing my country, preferably in Japan. That's why I came to Japan to learn Japanese and hopefully obtain a master degree in International Relations. After getting my master's degree in International Relations, I would like to go home and enter the diplomat school for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is a three year program, and then, after that hopefully come back to Japan and work for the Norwegian Embassy in Tokyo. 
Todd: Must be pretty competitive.
Christian: It's very competitive, but I think if you know a certain language that not many people speak it gives you a competitive edge nevertheless so that's why I came to Japan because I know at this stage there are only 300 hundred people from Norway living in Japan and not all of them are here to study Japanese, they represent different companies or schools, or they're missionaries so, that's the track I'm on right now but we'll see how it goes in the end.
Todd: How about when you were a child, what was your dream job? Did you want to be a diplomat when you were say, 10?
Christian: No, when I was ten I probably didn't know what I wanted to do. I was just too busy playing in the street, you know, having fun with my friends and these things. When I was that young I really didn't have a dream job like fireman, police. I never really went through that stage, you know.
Todd: I wanted to be a baseball player.
Christian: Alright, fair enough.
Todd: I'm still dreaming.
Christian: Oh, that's good.

In a pan you put garlic, onions, olive oil, and tomatoes. Fry that up. Put the chicken on top and then put a puree of tomatoes on top of that and just saute that for awhile and you can put it over white rice and you'll have yourself a nice meal 
Todd: Wow, that sounds pretty good.
Alexandra:  Yeah, it's very good, and for change you can always add green peppers, red peppers and make it very colorful, and serve it with some white plantains and a little Cuban drink and you are good to go.
Todd: Alright, thanks. I'm gonna give that a try.

Mari (Japan - American Accent)

Mari (Japan - American Accent)
Ron (USA)

Ron: My favorite cuisine has to be Hawaiian food. I grew up eating Hawaiian food so every special occasion we had Hawaiian food, so now when I eat Hawaiian food, it always brings back good memories.
Mari: What exactly is Hawaiian food?
Ron: Traditional Hawaiian food is usually cooked under the ground in a hole with hot rocks and it cooks for maybe six hours or seven hours and when you take it out, it's very salty because we use a lot of salt and it tastes really good ... usually meat ... usually pork and other vegetables like taro and potato.

Ron: The flavor is salt and also the leaf flavor that it's wrapped in.
Mari: What's your favorite dessert or junk food?
Ron: My favorite dessert has to be cake and ice-cream together. I love to eat cake and ice-cream together.
Mari: What's your favorite ice-cream flavor?
Ron: My favorite ice-cream flavor is strawberry, and I like to eat that with chocolate cake.

The words 'just' and 'only' have the same meaning and are interchangeable.  Notice the following: 
purposes

A purpose tells us why someone does something.  Notice the following: 
Other than that
I mainly watch the news. Other than that, sometimes I'll watch sport. 
The phrase 'other than that' means there is nothing more to do or say about something.  Notice the following: 
major
My major is International Relations. 
Our major is or was our area of study at college or university.  Notice the following: 
once in awhile

Heidi talks about what school is like for all ages in her home country of Mongolia.


Heidi (Mongolia)
Todd (USA)

Heidi: Oh sure. In Mongolia, we dont have elementary school, secondary school, or high school divided into three parts, but we have from 1st grade until 12th grade in one school so we dont really call them like high school or secondary school or elementary school. And for the high school, like, from the 8th grade until 12th grade, well, they study what other students study in different countries but nowadays they are focusing on more, like, English studies or different language studies. 
Todd: How long is a typical class? Do you have, lets say, six classes a day, each class is one hour? 
Heidi: We start school at 8:00 in the morning until 1:00 in the [after] noon and we have about six classes a day. Each class has like 45 minutes. So we finish at 1:00. 
Todd: And then, what do you do in the afternoon? 
Heidi: We go back.
Todd: You go home?
Heidi: Yes, cause in Mongolia we have two parts. In the morning, the high school students go to the school and from 1:30 the elementary school students go to the school so we share one class [between] two classes. 
Todd: Oh, so you split the school?
Heidi: Yes. 
Todd: So do teachers sometimes have to teach both levels? 
Heidi: Yes.
Todd: Wow! Thats tough. 
Heidi: Yeah.
Todd: So when you go home, do you usually...do have family there waiting or do usually both parents work?
Heidi: In Mongolia, the mother and father they usually work and when I finish my school I just go back and make my own food, because in Mongolia mothers work is not to, like, stay at home or do housework. Kids are taught to clean up the home and cook their food and wash their clothes and thats your work and usually the mothers dont do that kind of thing. 
Todd: Oh, so the children have to do all that work?
Heidi: Yes.
Todd: Actually its quite similar I think in the US pretty much. So what about your study load? Do you have a really heavy study load? Like, do you have two hours of homework a night or...?
Heidi: It really depends on the school but for me, like, I was studying in an international school so I had to study quite hard to get the level still. So for me, I studied after school...Id rather study at night, so I studied like 3 or 4 hours at night. So thats my study habit. 
Todd: Thats a lot. 
Heidi: Not really compared to other students. 

typical 
How long is a typical class?
Typical means normal or average. If something is surprising or unusual then it would not be typical. Notice the following examples:
lets say
Do you have, lets say, six classes a day?
Lets say is an informal way to say for example or lets imagine. Sometimes people also shorten lets say to just say. Here are some sample sentences:
split
So you split the school?
When you spilt something you divide it into two parts. Look at the following examples:
study load
You have a heavy study load.
A study load is the amount of classes or courses a student has to study. If a student has many difficult classes, then they have a heavy study load. If they have an easy schedule at school, then they have a light study load. Notice the following:
study habit
That's my study habit.
A habit is something one does again and again often without thinking. Therefore, a study habit is one's habit about studying. A student with good study habits probably studies the same about of time every day. A student with poor study habits probably only studies at the last minute before tests or assignments. Notice the following:

Todd talks about his favorite season.
Todd (USA)
Todd: My favorite time of year is autumn, or fall. I like the fall season because I think that's when the weather's the best. It's not too hot. It's not too cold. It's just nice and cool all the time. Also, usually it doesn't rain that much in autumn. The trees also are really, really beautiful in the fall. I love the change in colors when the leaves turn from green to brown, and orange and yellow and I think it's also really pretty to see the leaves on the ground. Also, I really like fall because I'm a big baseball fan and in the fall we have the baseball playoffs and it's the start of the basketball season and the football season, so it's a good time for me to watch sports on TV. Lastly, I like autumn because my birthday is in October, and um, October 2nd, and Halloween is in October and Thanksgiving is in November and these are all my, these are my three days throughout the year.

Todd: Surfing is popular in Sri Lanka?
Mini: M-hm. I mean, not popular amongst Sri Lankans but most of the... many tourists come, especially the Germans, they come to my country and surf because the hotels near the beaches are very cheap and it's very beautiful hotels and very cheap. Food is cheap. It's nice.
Todd: OK. So, we've got the Rock Castle, surfing on the beach. Anything else? 
Mini: And then a third thing should be the Tooth Temple. It's like the tooth of a Buddha, so we got it from I guess India, King Ashoka, so it's one of the things that you can see there. It's a really beautiful temple.
Todd: OK, I'm sorry. Can you say the name of that again?
Mini: Temple of Tooth Relic.

Jason (UK)
Todd (USA)
Todd: Jason, I saw that you have an amazing tattoo on your chest.
Jason: That's right, yeah, I'm not Yakuza though, so don't worry.
Todd: What's the reasoning behind the tattoo? Why did you get it?
Jason: I got the tattoo because I used to actually work as a tattooist, a long time ago but now I stopped that, so I can come traveling. I designed the tattoo myself. I drew it onto paper then I got my friend to actually tattoo it onto my body. I got a wolf really because I really love animals, and a wolf is my favorite animal.
Todd: So, you drew the tattoo.
Jason: I drew the tattoo, yeah.
Todd: Did it hurt when it was being sketched in your body?
Jason: Yeah, it did hurt, but tattoos can vary in amounts of pain depending where on your body it was. The chest is probably the worst place, which is where my tattoo is, so it hurt.
Todd: Why is the chest the worst place?
Jason: Because there's not much meat there, kind of, because there is a lot of bone. And, the closer to the bone it is, and the thinner the skin the more painful it's going to be.

Kerri: Well, usually it is just AP news or whatever.
Todd: OK. How much of the news do you think is true?
Kerri: I don't know. That's a tough question. I think that because there're so many journalists that often what makes into the papers is fairly accurate, but unfortunately some people leak information that is untrue to sway public opinion, so you have to kind of weed through things and consider why that news story is made public.
Todd: Yeah. How do most people in your country get the news?
Kerri: I think most people in the states get the news from TV and from the main broadcasting stations. The evening news sort of thing.

Tara now lives in Tokyo. She shares her thoughts on this Japanese city.
Tara (UK)
Tara: Hi, this is Tara. I'm going to talk about Tokyo. All in all, I've been in Tokyo now for about a year and three months, and I really love it here. Sometimes I find it hard because the culture is so different from where I am from, but I find the people really friendly and once you make Japanese friends they will really help you out with whatever you're doing. 
I work in the evenings so it's quite exciting for me to see, you know live in a big city and always see the nightlife. I do dancing here. I've had a lot of good experiences in Tokyo, some of the best times of my life, so, yeah, I'd like to stay here a bit longer, especially because I like looking at Japanese boys.

James: OK.
Todd: James, what is your favorite season?
